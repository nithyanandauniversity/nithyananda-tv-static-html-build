The temple was constructed by King Kulasekara Pandya. The temple has been mentioned in the songs sung by ancient enlightened poet Saints as early as the 7th century.\n\nThe first happening is the incident where Indra’s (Chief of celestial beings) sin is effaced. The history goes thus: Indra, the Chief of Devas (celestial beings), was engaged in destroying a demon who was terrorising the three worlds for which he waged a war against the Asuras (demons). Unfortunately the demon was a high born Brahmin (scholarly caste of highest order), whose slaying brought upon Indra a grave sin. Indra tried various means to rid himself of the sin, but to no avail. Once, in the realm of humans, passing through a forest of Kadamba trees, Indra felt the burden of the sin being miraculously lifted. Relieved of his sin, he looked for the source and found a Shiva Linga of incomparable beauty and exceptional prowess, in the shades of a Kadamba tree. Next to the tree was a Golden Lily pond, wherein Indra proceeded to cleanse himself by bathing in its waters and offering the golden lily to the Shiva Linga. This golden lily pond is the spot where the Meenakshi temple sacred golden lily pond stands today. It is the water tank of the temple.","embedUrl":"https://player.twitch.tv/?kailasainmadurai","slug":"sri-meenakshi-sundareshwara-thirukovil","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/kailasa_nithyananda_tv_og_d5d75dd641.jpg"}}}}},{"id":"11","attributes":{"title":"Sri Rajarajeshwari","description":"Darshan of Devi Rajarajeshwari at Sri Puram Sarvajnapeetham, KAILASA in Hyderabad\n\nRajarajeshwari is the focussed form of all Gods and Goddess; the sum total of all energies of the Cosmos.
