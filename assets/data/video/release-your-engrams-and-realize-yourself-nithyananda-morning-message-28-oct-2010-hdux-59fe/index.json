They are finding that long term; complicated grief activates neurons in remote centres of the brain, possibly giving memories addiction-like properties. Paramahamsa Nithyananda has experienced people who are so addicted to their pain; he cannot help them walk out of it. This creates a \"Mature Pain Body\" which can go on expanding and reproducing more and more pain bodies indefinitely.\nThis is a very important step.  If engrams become like addiction and aren't cleared, extraordinary suffering becomes a lifestyle. The brain starts believing that this is the juice of life. Montreal University researchers in Canada studied the brains of Zen meditators and found that meditation reinforces the central brain region and removes pain. In fact, this central area of the brain thickens.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda experienced this as well.  He reminds us that by unclutching and simply witnessing, we can thicken this part of the brain.  This in turn awakens the Kundalini shakti and non-mechanical parts of the brain.\nScientology founder L. Ron Hubbard declared engrams to be the root of all human ills.  By removing our engrams we can cure arthritis, asthma, high blood pressure, and the rest of the chronic illnesses plaguing modern day society.   Engrams get caught in our bio memory the way nuts get caught in frozen ice cream.  They can't be removed unless the ice cream thaws. Same way, deep devotion melts our biomemory and allows the engrams to be removed.  \nParamahamsa Nithyananda again reiterated that his new Cathartic course being planned which will heal the first layer of past from our system, will be offered by his temples and ashrams around the world.  This will be a huge service to humanity, and prepare people for tremendous transformation when they attend IA and LBE courses.  It will also move humanity into a higher state of consciousness.
