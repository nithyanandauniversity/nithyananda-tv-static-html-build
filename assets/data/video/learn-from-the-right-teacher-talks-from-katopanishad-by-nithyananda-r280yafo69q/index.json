Spiritual wisdom can never be grasped unless it is taught by an enlightened being. It can be realized only beyond logical reason, imprinted into the bone marrow. Thus, the four tattwas can only be taught by one who is living them completely. Only one who has accomplished authenticity can become an acharya. The way to discern whether a devotee has achieved authenticity is to note whether he can listen. If he listens patiently without any tiredness to every speaker, he is integrated and has found his authenticity. Then he is able to effectively transmit the truth to others\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday Nirahara Samyama starting, I welcome you all with my love and blessings!\n\nToday Nirahara Samyama 1st level 1st day 8th batch.

Great!\n\nLiterally we have a mobile temple, the whole set goes and lands and Nithyanandeshwara just fills the whole place. Beautiful. Hmm. As on now, we have 52 applications, still application are coming for Nirahara Samyama. Today I will be initiating all of you guys, all the 52 applicants into the 1st Level Nirahara Samyama after the Satsang.\n\nLet's enter the Satsang. I will continue on Authenticity with Kathopanishad.\n\nSecond Chapter 8th verse I will expand. Yesterday I started the 8th verse of the 2nd Chapter. Today I will expand on it. 2nd chapter 8th verse of Kathopanishad. Gurukul Kids, gurukul.\n\nGurukul Kids chanting:\n\nna nareṇāvareṇa prokta eṣa suvijñeyo bahudhā cintyamānaḥ |\n\nananyaprokte gatiratra nāsti aṇīyān hyatarkyamaṇupramāṇāt ||\n\nOnce More\n\nna nareṇāvareṇa prokta eṣa suvijñeyo bahudhā cintyamānaḥ |\n\nananyaprokte gatiratra nāsti aṇīyān hyatarkyamaṇupramāṇāt ||\n\nThe translation:\n\n\"When taught by an unenlightened being, this atman cannot be truly known even though frequently thought upon. There is no way to know it unless it is taught by an enlightened being an incarnation, for it is subtler than subtlest. It is beyond argument\".\n\nUnderstand there are somethings which has to be taught by the bone marrow just by you BREATHING, just by you LIVING it. An unenlightened being will not be able to teach the subtlest truths unless your whole cognizance becomes conscious cognizance you will not be able to teach. You will be caught. Just yesterday I was telling in the Brahmanyam Bahuputrataam, about Ma Maneesha's patience -- Listening, Listening, Listening for days together unless you become authentic to listening you will feel agitated, bored, irritated will not listen. You will try to jump. I was observing her for last so many days, not even one conversation she is trying to wind up quickly. Many time, I will say hey come to the point straight. That may be useful for different purpose but when you do this kind of work especially helping an individual to find their root thought pattern of suffering you need a tremendous listening. For last 17 days she is listening. I am so happy she is not shown tiredness even for a moment because she is never had a tiredness.\nI tell you guys, if I see that in you guys I know you have become authentic. All of you have become authentic. Because when you develop listening, you will not be able to carry inauthenticity in you, lack of integrity in you because the lack of integrity you are carrying that will be heard by you again and again. Listen, only when you are not listening to you, you can carry lack of integrity in you. If you are listening to you, the cry will be too much you will see to it, you will complete it. Why do you stop listening to you, because too much crying inside, the suffering is too much. One of my Brahmachaari said, I have too much pain the day, from the day I have come to the ashram I have not done anything big, so I don't want to come to this BB program. All I thought is arreh, you only have to come and sit. This is the exact pattern with which you are suffering. Unless you dig out the pattern and complete it. You are not going to get out of this suffering. And I wanted to tell you, he is the most sincere worker. Poor fellow -- Yogananda. Such a sincere guy. How many of you in the ashram feel that Yogananda is a real sincere guy. Yogananda just raise your head and see, look around.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r280yAFO69Q/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAkwCA0IllR7as8TlCZAzOElJeL3A","youtubeID":"r280yAFO69Q","viewCount":2981,"eventDate":"2013-02-01","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"33"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"learn-from-the-right-teacher-talks-from-katopanishad-by-nithyananda-r280yafo69q"}}
