LIVING ADVAITHA!\n \nEveryone will be exploding into Shivoham by living Advaitha.  From today, formally I inaugurate speaking on Upanishads.  From today, formally I inaugurate speaking on the Upanishads. By uttering the first Upanishad mantra, formally I inaugurate the Upanishad series. This expression will be called as ‘Living Advaitha Series’. And, as I already said, I am not going to interpret; I am just going to intercept the conversations of rishis and relay it to you all.  I am not going to be interpreting the conversations of rishis; I am just going to intercept the conversations of rishis.  And, with this mantra, I will inaugurate the Upanishad series.\n \nऊँ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते ।\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ।।\nॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः\n \nOm Poornamadhah Poornamidham Poornaath Poornamudhachyathe |\nPoornasya Poornamaadhaaya Poornamevaavasishyathey ||\n|| Om Shanthi, Shanthi, Shanthihi ||\n \n‘Living Advaitha’ means, realizing you are Whole, one with the Whole, you are not a broken or separated, divided part.  Please understand, ‘broken’ means, once for all taken out.  ’Separated’ means, internally divided. ‘Divided’ means, in the internal, sub-division. You are neither broken nor separated or even entered into sub-division from the Whole. The Whole, the Whole exists as Whole. It is not that now you will achieve Completion, and in the future you will experience Complete Completion.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/2015-mission-day-message#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9SPIBhMIA4I/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"9SPIBhMIA4I","viewCount":5030,"eventDate":"2015-01-01","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"2015-mission-day-message-9spibhmia4i"}}
