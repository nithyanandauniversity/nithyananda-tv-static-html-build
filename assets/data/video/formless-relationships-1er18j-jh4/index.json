In this clip, Swamiji sheds more light on Shiva.  He tells us  Shiva means Causeless Auspiciousness.  When you overflow with love, you will relax and be centered into your being.  Swamiji goes on to describe that when we are caught with lust we cannot be loving.  Swamiji tells us that when we are in any relationship, the importance is given to the other person, whether it is your guru, parent, spouse, or beloved.  He tells us to simply make a cognitive shift and give importance to the feeling.  This will transform us and help us shower the feeling of love to everyone by centering us to our being.
