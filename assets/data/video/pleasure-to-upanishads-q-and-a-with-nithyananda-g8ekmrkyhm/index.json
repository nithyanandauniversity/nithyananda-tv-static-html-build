Once we begin practicing completion with others, we realize that the other person is also learning completion, therefore enriching is happening. Completion brings awareness to our thinking which will ultimately lead us to enlightenment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday's Leela Dhyaan:\n\nMahadeva is gracing us showing the Leela of: \"VARUNAN VITTA KADALAI VATTRA SEIDHA PADALAM\".  Means the - I will give you the translation. \n\nOnce during Sundareswara's regime, when Sundareswarar was ruling -- actually Meenakshi was ruling; Sundareswarar never ruled Madurai he was just going around and living. He was not involved in administration; Meenakshi only did all the work and during Sundareshwara's time, Varuna, the God of Water sent a huge tsunami to destroy Madurai\n\nAnd Sundareswarar, the Lord of Madurai, immediately sent a few clouds and sucked the whole ocean and dried them out and saving  Pandya Kingdom.\n\nIt was a powerful miracle. The power of Integrity of Sundareswarar. The moment he wanted, the ocean becomes dry,  by the cloud.\n\nMahadeva is gracing us in that Leela.\n\nWe'll enter into today's Nithya Satsangh.  First, I wanted to share a few truths then I'll answer your questions.\n\nFrom yesterday, we started the Science of Completion.  Today is  third day.  We are going to enter into deeper levels of Completion.\n\nSee, the Science of Completion is such, only after you practice  few times you will even understand the importance of it. Verbally it can never be explained because, once you start completing, it opens a new world to you, altogether  a new world, altogether a new energy.\n\nHow much ever I may talk about Completion but only when you start sitting with the mirror and melting down, completing,  really you experience the new world opening altogether for you, the new world which can't be introduced. \n\nSee, in the Heaven, there are some things great like Kamadhenu, the cow which gives whatever you want, Kalpavruksha, the tree which gives you whatever you want, Parijatha, the flower  never withers away, with eternal fragrance. Because there are  few special things, you can describe Heaven based on those few special things but when you start Completion, what all will happen, everything will be special. So, I cannot introduce it by anything special. I cannot say, 'Do Completion. You will have Kamadhenu, you will have Kalpavruksha.'  No, when you do Completion, you are going to have Mahadeva himself. What Kamadhenu or Kalpavruksha?   Everything, everything right, everything good happens in your life when you do Completion.  Completion is so powerful process, it takes you to a different space of existence, different realm of existence, different reality of existence altogether.\n\nToday we are going to be working on deeper levels of Completion and especially discovering the root-pattern, finding out the root-pattern. Sometime you discover, sometime you invent root-patterns.  Please understand, because you are not able to discover, you mess up, mismatch, and you invent your own. \n\nI have seen people coming and telling, 'Swamiji, I developed this root-pattern at the age of forty-four.' \n\nIt is not root-pattern; it is rootless pattern you invent. But anyhow, inventing root-pattern can be  root-pattern.  You have to complete with that pattern with which you invent root-patterns. Whether it is root-pattern or rootless pattern, or root-pattern of creating rootless pattern as root-pattern, it has to be completed. Everything has to be completed. It is in the existence of Completion. Existence is experienced by you, because Existence exists in existence of Completion. Understand, the Completion is complete Completion when you experience Existence in its Completion.\n\nI'll try to answer your questions so that you can internalize and intranalyze the whole Completion process and understand and live the whole Completion process. \n\nQuestions?\n\nMa Maneesha: The first question today is from Inner Awakening participant Dr. Franjil ID No.57.  She is asking, 'If Enriching happens by an incomplete person, it doesn't really reach people.  It might help the enricher but the other person might be going away instead of coming. Should  the enricher be completely complete before enriching?'\n\nSwamiji: \"Completely completing\" will happen ultimately only with enlightenment. So, Dr. Franjil understand, Completion, Enriching, both are not supposed to be done one after another. Both are supposed to be done simultaneously. \n\nPlease understand, in Patanjali's Yoga, there's a word called \"Ashtanga Yoga\" -- \"Eight parts\".  Somehow, unfortunately, all the English Yogis have translated this as \"Eight steps of Yoga\".  That one small mistake the\"anga\" word. \"Ashta\" means \"eight\"; there is no controversy. This  \"anga\", instead of translating that word as \"parts\", it has been translated...","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_G8eKMRKyHM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCu6BoUVLr8LyDpQoj2LgIMbQ7XFQ","youtubeID":"_G8eKMRKyHM","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"pleasure-to-upanishads-q-and-a-with-nithyananda-g8ekmrkyhm"}}
