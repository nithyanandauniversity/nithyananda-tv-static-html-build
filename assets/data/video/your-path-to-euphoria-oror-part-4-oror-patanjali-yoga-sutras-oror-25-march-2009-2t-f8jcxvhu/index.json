Part 4\nDate: 25 March 2009\nVenue: Montclair, California, U.S.A.\n\nIn this video Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism HDH #Nithyananda Paramashivam translates the Patanjali Yoga Sutras. In this Sutra HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam goes more into depth about the exact meaning of renunciation. When we renounce because of fear, this is not true renunciation, thus this will not help us towards spiritual growth. \n\nThe affect imagination has on each of the energy centers, in Sanskrit called “Cakras”, is described in detail. Learn how different problems arise with each affected cakra.\n\nHDH Nithyananda Paramashivam shares in this video that it is the very Patanjali Yoga Sutra that started off His public lectures at the tender age of 11.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
