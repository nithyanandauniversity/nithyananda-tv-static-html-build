Paramahamsa Nithyananda advises everyone to finish off making our completions, dropping all the old cognitions we have about ourselves; we will then be ready to receive the Cosmic Cognitions – Upanishads. Get ready to receive the original cognition from the Cosmos!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLet me enter into today’s satsangh.  Get ready!  I am going to enter into the Upanishad Mantras!  Prepare yourself! \n \nPlease understand, these are the first, foremost, and final words given to the universe from the Universe, given to humanity from the Cosmos.  Listen!  This is the first and foremost, and final word!  Upanishads are not like Science, every day developing.  For example, today a scientist will come and declare something as truth.  Everyone will agree.  That will be considered as truth.  People will make their life’s decisions, align everything based on that truth.  In ten years, another scientist will come and prove that whole thing as false and declare something else as truth.  Then people will align their lives to that.  And then, after five years, somebody else will come and declare that as a lie and prove something else as truth.   Understand, if the truth is going to be changing tomorrow, it is not truth even today.  Upanishads are not like science which is evolving or changing.  It is like a scientist carries a lantern in a thick forest and tells the truths about the forest to the world, ‘There are ten trees, two snakes, and....dark.’  When you walk further, ‘No, no, the forest is not just ten trees and two snakes; it is more than twenty-five trees, and two elephants.’  When you walk further, ‘No, no, no, no, no, it is not even twenty-five trees.  Trees, trees, trees!  Any side we turn the lantern, it is trees, trees, trees all around, and different types of animals!’  This is what is Science!  But, Upanishads are a rishi sitting and seeing the whole forest in a flash of lightning and describing it!  Understand, the lantern descriptions will always change; but the rishi sitting in the peak of the hill, seeing the whole thing in one flash of lightning, and penning it down, is Upanishads!  Understand the difference between these two.  Upanishads are the first, foremost, and final word on truth!  First, foremost, and final word on truth! \n \nNothing, nothing like Upanishads declare all the truths in so close a way to the heart, in such a closer way to the heart.  Such a beautiful way to live!  User-friendly! \n \nUnderstand, clean your whole cognition and keep it ready!  I am going to reveal the first, foremost, final words given to all of us directly by the Cosmos without any interference of sons or prophets or any ambassador.  No!  No ambassador!  Not even incarnations, avatars!  No!  I wanted all of you to know, Gita (Bhagavad Gita) is “considered” as Upanishad, not Upanishad!  Gita is “considered” as Upanishad, not Upanishad.  Even the words of the incarnations are not kept in the same level of Upanishads in Hindu Tradition.  “Shruti”, “heard”.  Understand, the Upanishads are not “said” by any rishis; it is “heard” by the rishis.  Who said it?  It is Cosmos sang about itself!  So, no Son of God, no Ambassador of God, no Prophet of God, no Incarnation of God wrote this book.  It is directly the Universe declares about itself universally to the universe.  Clear up all your old cognitions about Life.  Clear up all your old cognitions about God.  Drop all your old cognitions about You.  Drop your old cognitions about the World.  Drop all your old cognitions and be fresh to receive the original Cosmic Cognition from the Comos itself to plan and live your life as the Cosmos wants you to live. \n \nIt is so juicy, I tell you!  This is the word I should use.  Upanishads are so “juicy” and so “spicy”!  It has a lot of spice, I tell you honestly!  It is not a dry book.  It gives such amazing understanding!  It has a lot of juice!  It has a lot of beauty!  It has a lot of joy!  It is so full of life!  It is so full of life!\n \nEach Upanishad mantra is a Cosmic Cognition for you to live as Cosmos.  Your relationship with You, your relationship with God, your relationship with Life, your relationship with everything can be defined and redefined with these Upanishadic mantras.  Upanishadic mantras!  Upanishadic mantras are far more powerful than any sound you can hear on Planet Earth.  In such powerful vibration, such powerful truths you are going to receive it.  Get ready!  Get ready!\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/upanishad-word-universe#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wSWWurf1uiU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"wSWWurf1uiU","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishad-is-the-word-of-the-universe-wswwurf1uiu"}}
