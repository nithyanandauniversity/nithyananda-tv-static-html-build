You will understand how you are missing some of the greatest experiences of life by getting caught in a blind logic. It is like, instead of cooling glass (dark glasses), you are wearing just two black stones fixed in a frame and say, “The whole world has become dark!” Who is responsible?  So, if you are using exponential logic for experiential matters and go on saying, “Experience is not happening”, then who is responsible?\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n\nI have something important to tell; that is why I have not read out all the cities’ names fully.  It is just too overflowing!  Today it was overflowing so much!  Usually, when I sit for Puja and offer the flowers and fall into Samadhi, that’s the time this downloading happens.  Today the downloading was too much!  Even eyes became watery and started getting wet!\n\nListen!  Just listen to these two words:\n\n· The Logic of experience; one word.  We will call it ‘Experiential Logic’. \n\n· The second word: Logic of calculation; whether multiplying, subtracting, adding, deleting.  The ‘Logic of Calculation’. We will call that.....I will give a new name – ‘Exponential Logic’.  Just by multiplying or subtracting exponentially, logic applied, used the exponential levels.\n\nUnderstand these two logics; you will understand how you are missing some of the greatest experience of life by getting caught in a blind logic.  It is like, instead of cooling glass (dark glasses), you are wearing complete no glass, just two black stones fixed in a frame!  If you get two black stones fixed in a frame and wearing it and thinking it is a cooling class and saying that whole world has become dark, who is responsible?  So, if you are using exponential logic for experiential matters and go on claiming, ‘Experience is not happening!’, who is responsible?\n\nSo listen!  Listen!  This, today’s one satsangh alone is enough to give you the experience and cognition and clarity, Shivoham! \n\nListen!  Listen sincerely! The Nakkeeran, Nakkeeran is the only guy seems to have argued with Mahadeva, knowing the guy who is standing in front of him is Mahadeva!  I tell you, then they both must have had some sweet relationship.  I am giving you the insider’s secret.  Otherwise, you will not have guts to argue.  ‘Even if I argue, whatever is said and done, end of the day he will not forsake me, he will not give up on me.  I am Avimuktha.’  The guy must have had that kind of a confidence that he is Avimuktha, because, earlier many times Nakkeeran was saved by Subrahmanya from demons, devils, rakshasi, one rakshasi. So there are lot of confidence in Nakkeeran that he is Avimuktha, never forsaken.  Otherwise, he will not have guts to argue with Mahadeva knowing that Mahadeva only has come!  You need to have a story line. \n\nOnce there was a king who had a doubt whether women have a natural smell in their hair or it is because of the perfumes and flowers.  And the king said, ‘Whoever clarifies my doubt, I will give thousand gold coins.’  Like those days’ million dollar kind of a lottery. \n\nOne priest of Sundareshwaras Temple......  In the Sundareshwaras Temple priest community, that Bhattar community, Bhattar, Deekshithar, all of them have a tradition: unless you are married, you can’t perform the rituals.  You need to be married to perform the rituals.  Even now the Deekshithars’ families, at the age of fifteen, fourteen the boys get married; because, unless you are married, you can’t do the puja.  It is a tradition. \n\nSo, this priest wants to get married, because he can start the ritual.  But he need money.  He went and asked Sundareshwara. \n\nSundareshwara is a living god, please understand.  He was never a dead statue.  He was a living god; just continuously responding to people and came down in human form again and again and again.  Came down, coming down, again yet to come down!  He is a living swaroopa!   \n\nThe priest goes to him and asks, ‘Give me money.’ \n\nMahadeva gives a verse, says , ‘This verse will clarify the doubt of the king.  Go and give it to him and take the thousand gold coins.’  He wants to do some leela. Otherwise he could have directly given thousand gold coin.  Why he should tell take this and go to the king and take it?  Anyhow...!\n\nThe song exactly actually means that women have a natural smell in their hair.\n\nLINK FOR FULL DESCRIPTION:- video/experiential-logic-vs-exponential-logic#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sd0T-KwcIsU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"sd0T-KwcIsU","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"experiential-logic-vs-exponential-logic-sd0t-kwcisu"}}
