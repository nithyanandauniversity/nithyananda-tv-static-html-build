Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains how all of our incompletions may look factual but they cannot be real. The ultimate truth is that our consciousness is completion, joy, love and fulfillment. Only when our SDHD grabs us, it creates superficial disturbances in us; they don’t go to our core. In this way, the truths of the Upanishads can penetrate to the core of us, transforming our being.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will continue on the Fortieth Chapter of Yajur Veda, Ishavasya Upanishad, Shanthi Mantra.  Please chant with me:\n \nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते |\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||\n|| ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ||\n \nOm Poornamadhah Poornamidham Poornaath Poornam Udhachyathey |\nPoornasya Poornamaadhaaya Poornamevaavasishyathey ||\n|| Om Shanthi Shanthi Shanthih ||\n \nI can see clearly, when these mantras were uttered the very first time to the Planet Earth, the path for the civilization was getting delivered, the unadulterated, undiluted purpose for the civilization, human civilization was getting delivered.  The whole ambience charged with peace – understand, I am using the word “charged with peace”; means, vibrant peace, vibrant silence; not the silence of the graveyard, but the silence of Unclutching, the silence of Completion – I can see clearly, in the vibrant presence of Mahadeva, all the rishis being raised and vibrating in the same frequency of Mahadeva; not just enlightened, but entangled with Mahadeva; in that entanglement, uttering these great verses.  Understand, the whole purpose is Completion. \n \nAll your incompletions may look factual.  See, I am not insensitive to your problem of diseases or unable to handle your desire or fear, or unable to handle your enemies, or unable to handle the powerlessness, whatever may be, I am not insensitive to it.  It may be factual, but, I am telling you, it cannot be real!  It may be factual, but it can never be real!  Let your cognition function constantly based on “real”.  Let you think, act, decide, respond, react, based on “real”, “real”.\n \nYour incompletions may be factual, but can never be real.  You understanding “Completion is Completion is Completion”, makes you recover quickly even from the so-called factual incompletions, I am telling you.  When you understand and cognize it is Completion in Completion in the space of Completion......  And I wanted to tell you one truth: Whenever I told anybody the ultimate truths that your consciousness is Completion, joy, love, fulfilment, I never saw one ray of doubt in any of them, please understand!  I have to reveal this truth to you.  Your SDHD (Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial) creates only superficial graphs in you; they don’t go to the core of you.  Your core listens to me!\n \nYou have layers of your being.  The mind you use for every-day activity – brushing, taking bath, eating – only that mind, that part of you gets confused or develops self-doubt, self-hatred, self-denial.  It is only skin deep.  I can call that as a “Freudian” mind, “fraudulent mind”.  Freud’s depth could go only to that depth, not more than that.  If Freud could have gone a little deeper, the history of today’s world will be different; the whole lifestyle of today’s world will be different.  Because, just below your “vested interests plan”, the vast, beautiful truth is vibrating continuously!  One dip into the Truth Ocean relieves you from all insecurity, fear, greed, and, naturally, all your vested interests will melt down, you will just stand for the Truth.  See, it is the superficial mind which conspires.\n\nThe last few days I am constantly soaked in the consciousness of the Vedic civilization.  When I was looking – I was just looking into the Akashic Records – I saw at that time of the Vedic civilization, on an average, a man worked only two to three hours a day.  And, listen, please listen, the society has four divisions (“varnas”):\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/upanishads-your-incompletions-can-never-be-real","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fGpXhqpJvGc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"fGpXhqpJvGc","viewCount":5582,"eventDate":"2015-01-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"33"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishads-your-incompletions-can-never-be-real-fgpxhqpjvgc"}}
