From the space of Advaita, inter planetary travels happened during the time of Kathopanishad. Vedic tradition explains 4 major powers of human society: knowledge, weapons, wealth and land. Vajashravas, the king and father of Naciketa, out of his powerlessness and insecurity, was confused of what would fulfill him and thus, developed the business metal set-up unsuitable for a ruler, who already owned the wealth.\nGiving the whole vedic scene, He declared the restarting of the Satya Yuga, the Vedic Golden Age of Enlightenment now. As a humble offering to the Vedic Rishis, He declared  to use the modern science to keep the unique DNAs developed through 'Gotras ' that were ifted to the world by our Rishis. \"\"Gotra\"\" is the code for inserting DNA layers to retain the different knowledge branches, sciences and bio-memories and now allow genetic disorders. The misinterpreted concept of caste discrimination was imposed by the foreign invaders on Indian lands, who invaded India to steal the best developed DNAs. There are profound references of Great Sages like Veda Vyasa being born from a Shudra, working class fisherwoman. Also, the Sati system was never part of Indian system, but was forcibly imposed by the invaders as they had brutally attacked the Indian women, who gracefully chose to exit life by burning their body. \n\nBy the grace of Mahadeva, not only the Upanishads will be revived, the whole Vedic tradition will be revived with all its spiritual possibilities. The age of controlling humans is over. It is the time of knowledge, of seeking, exploring in the Internet and IT Revolution, thanks to the youth, who are now exploring knowledge. Knowledge seeking is forbearer of Vedic Civilization.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kelBREZbUzA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"kelBREZbUzA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"revival-of-satya-yuga-the-golden-vedic-era-by-nithyananda-kelbrezbuza"}}
