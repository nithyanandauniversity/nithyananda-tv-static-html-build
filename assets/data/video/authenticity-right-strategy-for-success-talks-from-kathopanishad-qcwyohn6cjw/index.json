When we live the tattwas, the four noble truths of being, we enrich those around us. Until we participate in them with full consciousness we continue to be inauthentic. In ancient Vedic tradition, all sounds had power. Even today, when we speak with authenticity our words create our reality. When we speak inauthentically we encounter blocks in our lives. Sanskrit is the language of power because it is phonetic -- it is based on pure sound. Those who wish to transmit the noble tattwas should use their Sanskrit names. Sampoorthi = Integrity; Shraddha = Authenticity; Upayanam = Responsibility; Apyaayanam = Enrichment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday Brahmanyam Bahuputrataam happening successfully 8th day! It is the first level. We have already completed 2 batches 1st level. Today the 1st level 2nd batch is getting completed. 2nd level dates -- April 3rd to 12th -- level II. And April 13th to April 22nd\n\nThis time many people who want to be ashramites I have given them option of being in first level. Before coming to 2nd level you will first finish all completions and if with integrity, authenticity you are very clear to be ashramite, then you can apply for being an ashramite. If you clear 2nd level, then you will have ashramite initiation. Ashramites have to attend one of the two 2nd level also.\n\nNiraahaara samyama 1st level 2nd day today. Tomorrow we will be breaking the fast and give 2 day break and then start 2nd level. 8th batch successfully beginning!\n\nSarah Port Washington New York -- blessings! I accepted your paada puja and will  bless you during Dial the Avatar.\n\nKevin blessings for the Kaala Bhairava deity. Birthday blessings to Kaveena Ananda from San Jose. Ma Sunitha Hyderabad birthday blessings! Let us start today's satsang.\n\nIn Kathopanishad, 2nd chapter 9th verse -\n\n \"न एषा तर्केण मतिः आपनेया | प्रोक्ता अन्येन एव सुज्ञानाय प्रेष्ठ ।\n\nयां त्वम् आपः सत्यधृतिः बत असि| तादृक् नो भूयात् नचिकेतः प्रष्टा ॥ 2.9||\"\n\n\"State of enrichment not attainable by logical understanding. Only by living being these truths can be transmitted. Oh Nachiketa! You attained through your shraddha -- sincerity, authenticity. Oh Nachiketa! Will another authentic seeker as you ever by found?\"\n\nThanks to Ma Bhaktimaya for beautiful translation. Amazing. Just adopt these few more rules -- no negative words. Like how we teach the Grukul kids the conscious cognition -- zero negative words. First rule. 2nd if there are ten words in each sutra, each word all the possible, available translation. Words should be made available in front of your eyes. Then authentically and consciously cognize that the maximum words come in the translation to see what the Rishi's perspective and what he is trying to convey to the reader. This is the law of translation.\n\nAnd it is very easy to pick up the translation.....you just know you can just match it and see the meaning.\n\n\"न एषा तर्केण मतिः आपनेया | प्रोक्ता अन्येन एव सुज्ञानाय प्रेष्ठ ।\n\nयां त्वम् आपः सत्यधृतिः बत असि| तादृक् नो भूयात् नचिकेतः प्रष्टा ॥ 2.9||\"\n\n\"State of enrichment not attainable by logical understanding. Only by living being these truths can be transmitted. Only by the being who enriched himself with these truths this can be transmitted. (can you alter the translation?) Nachiketa! You attained through your shraddha -- sincerity, authenticity. Oh Nachiketa! Will another authentic seeker as you ever by found?\"\n\nThese tatvaas becoming satyas happens only by living. Please listen. Just today morning we were having the commitments and completion sessions we were having for ashramites. The subject came up why the non-participation. Participation does not just mean picking up the mike and talking. Even otherwise it involves how you are listening, how your body language is, how you are cognizing. Fortunately I can see what is happening in your mind....so the cognizance and the listening is also participation. So I was scanning why the non-participation? Suddenly I discovered the root -- why the non-participation? When you have different personalities and constantly try to engage them in an inauthentic way instead of integrating them, it happens. I gave an example, if you have a lawyer friend, you say I am going to become a lawyer and your assistant to appease him, you say I am going to become a doctor and your assistant and appease him, you say I am going to become engineer and your assistant to appease him, you say","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCWYoHN6cjw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDTOSGNyh4JjutQOl6TqetYX-ZviQ","youtubeID":"QCWYoHN6cjw","viewCount":6037,"eventDate":"2013-02-02","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"authenticity-right-strategy-for-success-talks-from-kathopanishad-qcwyohn6cjw"}}
