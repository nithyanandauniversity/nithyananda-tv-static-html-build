He gave the straight definition of karma, “any thought current or thought pattern in which you are stuck is Karma. Suffocating thought currents, suffocating thought patterns, suffocating thought trends, is Karma.” We may have heard many concepts, truths but if they have not caused our reality and are not giving us constant breakthrough, it is only karma for us.\nFrom his ferocious space of Kalabhairava, Sadashiva, which does not accept the part-time freedom in which people are stuck, Paramahamsa Nithyananda opened the way to be liberated from karmas. The way out of this huge net of karma is – to discard the whole thought current we have. “NA ITI, NA ITI, not this, not this. Not just discarding one thought, thought pattern, discarding thought current is Completion.” In the Q&A session that followed, Paramahamsa Nithyananda, from His enlightened liberated being, questioned the many answers we have about karma – what are the types of karma, how to cancel the karmic bondages, and if karma can be burnt, changed.\nThe ultimate solution to be liberated and break from all karmas is INNER AWAKENING. “Breaking everything that can be broken or can’t be broken in you, is Awakening. Whatever you cannot break in you, whatever I can break it, is Inner Awakening.” (www.innerawakening.org)\n\nThis video provides link to the following video's:\nDecide to Break Your Karma Patterns\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZXF1gLtl-I\nDeciding For Life Clears All Karma's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aRN3eiQyOI\nLife Gives What You Asked For\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbG9KdgY9R8\nWhat Is Good, What Is Bad?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKK5ol7clpM","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bQVdF_AY2QI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"bQVdF_AY2QI","viewCount":97559,"eventDate":"2015-08-02","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"36"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"secrets-of-karma-revealed-by-paramahamsa-nithyananda-bqvdfay2qi"}}
