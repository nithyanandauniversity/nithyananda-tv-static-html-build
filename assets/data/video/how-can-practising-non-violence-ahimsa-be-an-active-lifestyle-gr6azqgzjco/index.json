NONVIOLENCE MEANS NOT ONLY YOU WILL BE NONVIOLENT - PRACTISING AHIMSA, YOU WILL ACTIVELY PRACTISE AHIMSA AND ENRICH EVERYONE TO LIVE AHIMSA. YOU WILL CREATE AN ECOSYSTEM WHERE AHIMSA CAN BE PRACTISED WITH INTEGRITY.\n\n*ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED TO KEEP THE NONVIOLENT AHIMSA ALIVE. MEDIA IS THE NONVIOLENT WAY OF REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE AND TELLING THE TRUTHS AND FACTS. SO MEDIA, EDUCATION MECHANISMS, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ACTIVELY FILLED WITH THE TRUTHS AND IDEAS ABOUT NONVIOLENCE, TYAGA, SPIRITUAL STRENGTH, POWERFUL COGNITIONS.\n\n*AGAIN AND AGAIN, MANY ARE TRYING TO HARASS ME THROUGH THE SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING, ‘YOU ARE TEACHING CONSTANT NONVIOLENCE, AHIMSA, PEACE. DON'T YOU SEE YOU ARE MAKING HINDUS WEAKER?’\n\n*IF THEY UNDERSTAND ME, THEY WILL SEE I AM TRYING TO MAKE THEM REALLY STRONGER! STRENGTH IS THE INTELLIGENCE OF EXISTING. IT IS NOT VIOLENCE, TERRORISM OR CONVERSION. NEITHER BY CONVERSION NOR BY TERRORISM ANY RELIGION IS GOING TO SURVIVE IN THE FUTURE. THE FUTURE OF RELIGION IS NOT GOING TO BE DECIDED BY THEIR CAPACITY OF CONVERSION OR TERRORISM. THAT PERIOD IS OVER. THE NEXT GENERATION IS NOT INTERESTED IN CONVERSION OR TERRORISM. IT IS INTERESTED IN LIVING LIFE AND LIFE POSITIVITY.\n\n*THE BIGGEST MISTAKE HINDUS DID IN THE NAME OF NONVIOLENCE AND TYAGA IS, THEY WITHDREW FROM LIFE. A REAL TYAGI WILL BE SO ALIVE, ACTIVE AND ENRICHING THE WHOLE WORLD FOR TYAGA.\n\n*REAL NONVIOLENCE IS NOT ONLY YOU WILL BE LIVING THE NONVIOLENCE, THROUGH ALL POSSIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE MEDIA AND EDUCATION SYSTEM, YOU WILL BE ENRICHING THE WHOLE WORLD ACTIVELY WITH NONVIOLENCE AND TYAGA. THIS IS THE SURVIVAL NEED OF THE WORLD, OF HUMANITY.\n\n*I APPRECIATE HINDUS HOLDING ON TO THE PRINCIPLES OF AHIMSA AND TYAGA, BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU MISSED. HUMAN BEINGS THINK ONLY AGGRESION IS ACTIVTY AND EITHER CONVERSION OR TERRORISM IS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY, NO!\n\n*ACTIVELY ENRICHING IS THE REAL SPIRITUALITY-BASED RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY. HINDUISM IS SPIRITUALITY-BASED, ENLIGHTENMENT-BASED TRADITION. HINDUS SHOULD HAVE REACHED THIS TO THE WORLD THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, TO TELL THE RIGHT NARRATIVE OF HINDUISM, HOW IT IS AHIMSA, TYAGA BASED.\n\n*HINDUS SHOULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND TO THE WHOLE WORLD. THEY MISSED THIS IMPORTANT ACTION. SHRIKAILASA IS FORMED TO FILL THIS GAP AND DO THIS IMPORTANT ACTION. IT IS NOT ONLY TO SPREAD, BUT TO ENRICH ACTIVELY THE NARRATIVE OF AHIMSA, TYAGA.\n\n*THE PURPOSE OF SHRIKAILASA IS TO MAKE HINDUS UNDERSTAND WHAT IS TYAGA, NONVIOLENCE, COMPLETION, UNCLUTCHING, THE SCIENCE OF SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS, ENLIGHTENMENT.\n\n*HINDUS SHOULD START ACTIVELY ENRICHING HINDUS FIRST ABOUT REAL TYAGA, NONVIOLENCE, AHIMSA, SACRIFICE, RENUNCIATION, COMPLETION, POWERFULNESS - THE GREAT AND POWERFUL COGNITIONS OF HINDUISM WHICH NEED TO BE GIVEN TO HUMANITY.\n\n*WE SHOULD REACH OUT TO HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANISATION AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ELIMINATE THE WRONG NARRATIVES ABOUT HINDUS. I REALLY WANT THE HINDUS TO ACTIVELY ENRICH THE WORLD.\n\n*HINDUISM NEITHER BELIEVES IN CONVERSION NOR IN TERRORISM. HINDUISM IS THE OLDEST LIFE POSITIVE TRADITION, RELIGION.\n\n*I WILL GIVE YOU PRECISELY, A ONE LINE ANSWER FOR ALL THE SUFFERINGS HINDUS ARE GOING THROUGH NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD: HINDUS MISSED ENRICHING ACTIVELY AND REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF NONVIOLENCE. NONVIOLENCE MEANS DROPPING AGGRESSION, TERRORISM, ANGER, NOT DROPPING ACTIVISM AND ENRICHING AND WITHDRAWING FROM LIFE. THEY MISUNDERSTOOD.\n\n*TILL NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE HINDUS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENRICHING. LAST 500 YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY LIFE NEGATIVE IDEAS SUCH AS: IF SOMETHING IS THE GREAT TRUTH AND SPIRITUALITY IS REAL, IT WILL SPREAD BY ITSELF AND WE DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING.\n\n*NO TERRORISM, CONVERSION, VIOLENCE AND NO INACTIVISM. TERRORISM IS MURDEROUS, INACTIVISM IS SUICIDAL. YOU INVITE PEOPLE TO COME AND KILL YOU. HE KNOWS YOU ARE NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT IS BEING DONE TO YOU.\n\n*TODAY IS MARCH 2ND. I FACED THE WORST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON THIS VERY DAY. LITERALLY, MARCH 2ND, 3RD 4TH, 5TH, THIS ONE WEEK, THEY TRIED ATLEAST TEN TIMES IN DIFFERENT YEARS VERY AGGRESSIVELY PLANNED ATTEMPTS. THEY LOCKED ME INSIDE THE ROOM AND PUT THE PETROL BOMB AND BURNT IT.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gR6AzQgzJCo/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"gR6AzQgzJCo","viewCount":4923,"eventDate":"2020-03-02","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"how-can-practising-non-violence-ahimsa-be-an-active-lifestyle-gr6azqgzjco"}}
