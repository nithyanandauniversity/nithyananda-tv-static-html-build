Paramahamsa Nithyananda expresses a life changing, deep insight: Any problem in our life is because of an incompletion that is imaginary! Walk out of any disease with completion! When we are complete inside, no can harm us as the Cosmos functions on completion. Completion is powerful medicine and methodology for life. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n\nUPANISHADS!  This first mantra, Shanthi Mantra of Ishavasya Upanishad, which is in the Fortieth Chapter of Yajur Veda, it is given first place in the series of Upanishads.  I should just say a few words about these Upanishads and mantras.\n\nThere are four major Commenatries on Upanishads.  Four major Commentaries: Neelakanta Shivacharya, Adi Guru Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya.  All four of them are great enlightened beings, incarnations.  No question of comparing anybody with others.  All four of them made Upanishads user-friendly for a different type of group at different times.  So, please understand, the differences you see in the different Commentaries of the Masters is not because of the Masters, it is because of the disciples. \n\nWhen Neelakanta Shivacharya – he is the first one who wrote the Commentary, much earlier to Adi Guru Adi Shankaracharya, Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya – when Neelakanta Shivacharya was writing the Commentary, what was the need of the society, human society at that time, what needs to be highlighted for them, what is the best way they will all be able to experience the Upanishads, from that angle he presented the Upanishads.  And then comes Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya.  He is one of the greatest incarnations.  He reveals the Upanishads for that time and for that human society.  Please understand, ‘Why the differences between the Masters?’, should be understood. \n\nSomebody came to me.  He came for a debate, and straight he started asking, ‘Swamiji, even among our own acharyas there is no one conclusion.  How can we follow anything?  Hinduism is just chaos and confusion!’ \n\nI said, ‘Who funded your education?!!’\n\nThese people, the Hindus educated by the anti-Hindu forces, are most dangerous than any anti-Hindu forces!  These people confuse the common man and destroy Hindu Tradition, understand?  As an inheritor of Hindu wisdom – not “self-styled”; I am born Hindu, brought up as Hindu! – I am telling you, please understand, the differences between the acharyas’ Commentaries are not because all the acharyas’ “anubhoothi”, experience, was different.  No!  The need of the society, need of the disciples, need of the human society at that time was different!  So, when each acharya happened – the Upanishads are like an ocean – each one of them made the Upanishads user-friendly for that time and society.  The differences of the acharyas and their Commentaries should be taken as the richness of Hinduism, and not as chaos or confusion of Hinduism.  So, they provided paths for different mindsets.\n\nWhen I was going through – fortunately I was able to access all the four: Ramanuja, Shankara, Neelakanta Shivacharya and Madhwacharya – all their “bhashyas”, Commentaries, I tried my best to find some difference between them.  Please understand, with all my integrity I am telling you, in the main core truths, all four of them are not at all differing!  Not at all differing!  When it comes to applying or achieving that experience, the methodology they are deriving, the methodology they are developing, asking us to practice to reach that space and trying to make those great truths into a user-friendly way of practicing, and trying to make that as a cognition of us, our inner-space, only at that point all four of them have their own methodology. \n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/upanishads-%E2%80%93-made-user-friendly-society#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/N940rafYDFw/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"N940rafYDFw","viewCount":4547,"eventDate":"2015-01-20","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishads-made-user-friendly-for-society-n940rafydfw"}}
