In this video Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Bhagavan #Nithyananda Paramashivam, gives a detailed explanation of the Sutra: \"Relaxing from these patterns through constant and intensive practice of unclutching\". Through this one Sutra, a person can become enlightened. This one Sutra is self sufficient and individually independent in leading a person to the ultimate truth and is the ultimate solution for all problems and obstacles faced in the path of yoga. By understanding this one Sutra, it is not important what is being practised. It is the intensity which is intelligent enough to lead a person to the ultimate practice and enlightenment. Even if a person takes up wrong or crude practices, the very intensity, the very sincerity is intelligent enough to lead a person to the right teaching, right practice and enlightenment. His Divine Holiness Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, goes on to explain how the great Master Rama Krishna became enlightened and narrates other examples of how people became enlightened just by the power of their intensity and sincerity.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
