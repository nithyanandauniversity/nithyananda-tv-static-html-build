YOU MERGING INTO HIM IS PARAMASHIVA GADHI. EITHER YOU SHOULD BE MANIFESTING PARAMASHIVATVA OR MERGING IN PARAMASHIVA GADHI.\n\n*TO ALL MY KIDS, I WANT TO TELL THIS: DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT MOKSHA CENTRIC, PARAMASHIVATVA OR PARAMASHIVA GADHI CENTRIC.\n\n*ONE SMALL INCIDENT:\nMY GURU, YOGANANDA PURI USED TO TELL ME, ‘DON'T EAT IN THE NIGHT TIME. ONCE SUN SETS, DON'T EAT. AFTER SUNSET IF YOU FEEL HUNGER, IT IS FALSE HUNGER.’\n\n*IN TAMIL HE WILL TELL CUTELY, ‘AFTER SUNSET IF YOUR STOMACH FEELS HUNGER, IT IS FALSE HUNGER. DON'T GIVE IT FOOD. TAKE A COLD WET CLOTH. DIP IT IN COLD WATER AND PUT IT ON YOUR STOMACH. IT SHOULD TOUCH YOUR LIVER. THE WHOLE AREA YOU SHOULD COVER AND SLEEP OFF.’\n\n*IN INDIA, THIS IS USED AS DEFINITION OF POVERTY WHERE PEOPLE WOULD SAY, ‘WE DON’T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD, SO WE JUST PUT WET CLOTH OVER THE STOMACH AND SLEEP.’ IT IS NO MORE A SYMBOL OF POVERTY. IT IS A SYMBOL OF RICHNESS NOW! THIRD RATE, POOR, LOWER MIDDLE CLASS, EAT LIKE A PIG 3 TIMES A DAY. RICH ROYAL KINGS ONCE IN A MONTH!\n\n*STOP EATING AFTER SUNSET. DON'T ASSOCIATE FOOD AND RICHNESS.\n*AFTER SUNSET IF YOU ARE FEELING HUNGRY, YOUR STOMACH IS LYING TO YOU. IT IS FALSE HUNGER. JUST PUT A WET CLOTH ON YOUR STOMACH COVERING UP TO THE LIVER AREA AND SLEEP. ONLY FIRST FEW DAYS YOU MAY STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT, BUT DO THIS FOR HEALTH.\n\n*ONE PERSON ASKED MY GURU, ‘WILL I NOT GET GASTRIC PROBLEM IF I DON’T EAT WHEN I AM FEELING HUNGRY?’\n\n*HE SAID, ‘GASTRIC PROBLEM WON'T KILL YOU. BUT IF YOU EAT AFTER SUNSET, YOU WILL GET LIVER PROBLEM AND DIE!’\n\n*AFTER SUNSET, YOUR BODY HAS ENOUGH FIRE/FUEL, JATARAGNI, ONLY TO BURN WHAT IS ALREADY CONSUMED.\n\n*IN DIGESTIVE FIRES, THERE ARE 3 LEVELS. JATARAGNI HAS 3 FORMS OF EXISTENCE.\n\n*AFTER SUNSET THE JATARAGNI DOES NOT HAVE THE ENERGY NEEDED TO RECEIVE MORE LOAD.\n\n*AMONG THE BRAHMANAS, THE AGNI GOTRIS AND BHARADWAJA GOTRIS - FLYING BRAHMANAS DON’T EAT AFTER SUNSET. IT WAS BHARADWAJA RISHI WHO WROTE THE WHOLE SCIENCE OF FLYING. THOSE BRAHMANAS USED TO FLY AND MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE.\n\n*HINDUISM HAD BOTH THE MECHANISMS - AS AN INDIVIDUAL WE COULD FLY HAVING A SMALL ATTACHMENT TO THE BODY - AKASHA MARGA - AND WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGY TO FLY AS A GROUP! WE HAD BOTH TECHNOLOGIES, MECHANISMS.\n\n*THE ADISHAIVA VELLALAR COMMUNITY AND THE JAIN COMMUNITY DON’T EAT AFTER SUNSET.\n\n*NOT EATING AFTER SUNSET IS ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENCE KINDLING TECHNIQUES.\n\n*EVERY NIGHT, IT IS NOT THAT YOU FALL INTO THE SAME DREAM STATE OR DEEP SLEEP STATE. DEPENDING ON THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BODY ON THAT DAY, THE STATE IN WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SETTLE DOWN WILL BE DECIDED.\n\n*IF THERE IS SO MUCH OF FOOD, TOXINS IN YOUR BODY, NATURALLY YOU WILL FALL INTO THE SHIT STATE.\n\n*IF YOU HAVE DONE NIRAHARA SAMYAMA, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, EVEN YOUR SLEEP WILL BE ROMANTIC, LIGHT, BEAUTIFUL!\n\n*WHY YOU LIKE ROMANCE SO MUCH YOU KNOW? IT MAKES YOU LIGHT. IT GIVES YOU JAGRAT-SUSHUPTI EXPERIENCE: THE LIGHTNESS OF SUSHUPTI AND ALIVE FEELING OF JAGRAT!\n\n*IF YOU STOP EATING AFTER SUNSET, THE BODY GOES THROUGH SELF CLEANING. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT IN 11 DAYS, THE WHOLE NIGHT, THAT STATE WILL BECOME A ROMANCE KIND OF A SPACE.\n\n*STOP EATING AFTER SUNSET.\n\n*FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO WITH YOUR ATMA LINGA. YOU WILL SIMPLY SEE THAT IN THE NIGHT, YOU WILL BE CUDDLING PARAMASHIVA, YOU WILL BE SLEEPING IN THE LAP OF PARAMASHIVA!\n\n*LESS FOOD OR NO FOOD IN THE STOMACH IN THE NIGHT, KEEPS YOUR WHOLE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS PURE.\n\n*HALF AN HOUR OF TURIYA STATE OR THE SWEET ROMANCE SPACE, REJUVENATES YOUR BODY AND MIND MORE THAN 10 HOURS OF SLEEP AND DREAM STATE. THE QUANTITY OF YOUR SLEEP WILL DRASTICALLY REDUCE. THE TIME YOU ARE ROLLING ON THE BED WILL DRASTICALLY REDUCE. THE QUALITY OF YOUR REJUVENATED FEELING WILL DRASTICALLY INCREASE.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4283922591695558\n\n\n\n\nRegister: paramashivoham.org","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pLfQlxFSnkg/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"pLfQlxFSnkg","viewCount":4020,"eventDate":"2020-08-28","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"only-learn-things-that-are-enlightenment-centric-and-directly-help-you-manifest-powers-plfqlxfsnkg"}}
