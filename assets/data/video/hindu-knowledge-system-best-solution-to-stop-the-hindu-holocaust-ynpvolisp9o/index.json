AHIMSA MEANS, ABSOLUTE EXTREME LIFE POSITIVITY IN EVERY LEVEL.\n\n*FOR EXAMPLE, MEAT-EATING, IS NOT ONLY VIOLENCE DONE TO THE ANIMAL FROM WHOM THAT MEAT WAS TAKEN, IT IS A VIOLENCE DONE TO YOUR STOMACH, INTESTINE BECAUSE YOUR SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED FOR MAKING MEAT AS A REGULAR FOOD.\n\n*THE EARLY HUMAN BEINGS - THEIR SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO DIGEST THE MEAT BECAUSE OF THEIR LIFESTYLE. ONCE THE CIVILIZED, THE SO-CALLED MODERN DAY LIFESTYLE STARTED, WHEN HUMAN BEINGS WERE NOT LIVING IN THE FOREST AND HUNTING FOR FOOD, WHEN THEY STARTED SETTLING DOWN, THE WHOLE BODY, MIND, BRAIN, STARTED DEVELOPING THE NEW SYSTEM. THE NEW SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED FOR NON-VEGETARIAN FOOD, MEAT AS REGULAR FOOD. SO MEAT IS A VIOLENCE EVEN ON YOUR SYSTEM, NOT JUST AGAINST THE ANIMAL FROM WHOM YOU GET AND EAT.\n\n*THE EARLY HUMAN BEINGS EATING MEAT CANNOT BE THE REASON FOR YOUR EVOLVED SYSTEM ALSO FORCED TO EAT MEAT. IN A WAY, THERE IS NOTHING SIMILAR BETWEEN THE EARLY HUMAN BEING AND THE MODERN HUMAN BEING.\n\n*YOU, ME, UNIVERSE - ALL THREE EXIST, NOT ONLY NOT HURTING EACH OTHER, BUT CELEBRATING THE EXISTENCE OF EACH OTHER. THAT IS NONVIOLENCE.\n\nRead more at: www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/3849801331774355","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ynPvOlIsP9o/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ynPvOlIsP9o","viewCount":2982,"eventDate":"2020-05-09","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"29"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"hindu-knowledge-system-best-solution-to-stop-the-hindu-holocaust-ynpvolisp9o"}}
