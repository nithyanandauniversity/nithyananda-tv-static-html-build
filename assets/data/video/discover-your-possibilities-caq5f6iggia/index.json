The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In this morning's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 5, Verse 5, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) encourages us to explore our possibilities. The two extremes of self-exploration are motionless meditation and intense action. Both lead us to the same state of spiritual freedom. Self-exploration through contemplation is jnana samyama, enlightenment through wisdom; self-exploration through action is karma samyama, enlightenment through industriousness. Exploring one's physical possibilities is yoga, bodily expression of the divine; emotional exploration leads to bhakti, the feeling connection with God; mental exploration results in siddhi, super-conscious ability; and spiritual exploration gives us mukti -- enlightenment. All these possibilities are available to each of us: we have only to choose our route. The destination is eternally the same.\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nLets enter into today's satsang, 5th Chapter Sanyasa Yoga, 5th verse.\n\nyat-saankhyaihi praapyate staanam tadyo gairapi gamyate |\n\nekam sankhyam cha yogam cha yah pashyati sa pashyati ||\n\nTranslation: only the one who perceives discriminative knowledge and intense action as one really perceives, for the state achieved through discriminative knowledge and intense action is one and the same. Bhagavan is showing the beautiful path of attaining the ultimate. Bhagavan is using two times the same word -- pashyati.\n\nyat-saankhyaihi praapyate staanam tadyo gairapi gamyate |\n\nekam sankhyam cha yogam cha yah pashyati sa pashyati ||\n\nyah pashyati sa pashyati -- that is the keyword in this whole verse. Who perceives the discriminative knowledge and intense action as one, only he perceives the truth, the ultimate. How can you perceive the knowledge, the atma vichara and karma yoga both as one and the same? How is it possible?\n\nBecause human beings have innate hatred to work, intense action. If somehow they get tuned, the build a pattern of intense action, they develop innate hatred to just sitting and contemplating, exploring themselves. Unfortunately human beings are always single sided. They tend to lean to one extreme. Either you move to the contemplation, mental work or you move to intense action, physical work.\n\nVery rarely people perceive both as one and the same. I tell you, the keyword in this verse -- yah pashyati sa pashyati, I can give you one key to understand the discriminative knowledge and intense action is one and the same. The bridging point is exploring your possibility is samyama. Discovering your own possibilities is samyama.\n\nIf you are discovering your possibilities by constantly contemplating, you are doing jnana samyama. If you are exploring all your possibilities through intense action, you are doing karma samyama. If you do samyama, either on jnana or karma, you will understand both are one and the same.\n\nI can tell you from my own experience how I was exploring my different possibilities and sharing with the world. You start looking at my life. From the age of 12, I can say, I started exploring jnana samyama through contemplation, exploring and discovering my various possibilities.\n\nPlease understand, when you explore and discover your emotional possibilities, that ripes into bhakti. When you explore and discover your physical possibilities, you become yogi. When you explore and discover your mental possibilities, it becomes siddhis. When you explore and discover your conscious possibilities, it becomes enlightenment.\n\nFrom the age of 12, I was constantly exploring and discovering my various possibilities through contemplation. From the age of 22, I am exploring and discovering my various possibilities through intense action. If you see, when I started my public life, my activities, I was not even able to speak English fluently more than a few sentences.\n\nI started my public life in 2003. And at the most I could sit for 2-3 hours, and take some classes or do some healing. Then I will lie down. My body was not capable of continuously working. But I could see very clearly, when I started the exploring and discovering my capabilities, my possibilities, now so many extraordinary truths get downloaded into the system without even my effort and comes out.\n\nAnd hours and hours of intense action, work automatically is happening in my system without even me remembering the idea of tiredness. Forget about controlling or suppressing tiredness. The idea of tiredness! The possibilities... when you explore the possibilities and discover,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Caq5F6iggIA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLADXuvEaviihEPjcVmsPHl7q4IKvg","youtubeID":"Caq5F6iggIA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"discover-your-possibilities-caq5f6iggia"}}
