In the Vedic tradition, today is the day of light -- the conscious light awareness. We celebrate the consciousness and its awareness. One of the expressions of consciousness is awareness. Awareness is one of the expressions of consciousness not consciousness itself. Consciousness expresses itself in many ways, one is awareness.\nOne of the oldest celebrations in Vedic tradition is this -- karthik deepam festival. In North India they call it Dev Deepavali. It is a very powerful understanding which is celebrated in this day. In the morning they light one light in front of the main energy centre in each city. From it many lamps will be lit for each deity. In the evening all lamps will be merged into main lamp. This is a very powerful understanding. One becoming many and again, many merging into one. \nToday is the day Shiva appeared as light beam the consciousness to Brahma and Vishnu.  Brahma is the highest intellectual possibility. Vishnu is the highest infrastructural possibility. Matter has 2 parts -- mind and physical. The highest possibility in the mind is Brahma, the highest possibility in the physical realm is Vishnu. Both of them thought they are the ultimate! Usually it happens. When you reach something extraordinary in any one field you just feel done - you are the highest. So Shiva has to liberate them give them the ultimate enlightenment. \nToday is also Devi's enlightenment day. Devi does great penance of panchaagni tapas to achieve enlightenment to become one with Shiva and evening when the sun sets and the moon rises, Shiva appears as the light pure consciousness and gives the half to Devi and Devi realizes her masculine part and she becomes Ardhanareeshwara -- means part of Shiva. So if you are in male body and realize the feminine part in you, you are enlightened and if you are in the feminine body and realize the male part in you, you are enlightened. You experience the same thing Devi experienced. These 10 days of Brahmotsavam, each day Shiva gives enlightenment to one person. The whole festival is about giving enlightenment to different people. \nIt is a very powerful truth. Whatever was created all of it goes back and merges into the ultimate Shiva. All lamps lighted is prakruthi -- Devi. I the evening all lamps merging with the main lamp is Purusha -- Shiva. The Prakruthi merges into Pruusha on this day.\nSwamiji ended the discourse with the blessing, \"Let you all become Prakruthi merging into Purusha Shiva.\" \n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
