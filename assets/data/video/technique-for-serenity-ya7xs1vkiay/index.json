The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verses 13 & 14, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) presents Sri Krishna's exact instructions for the posture we should use to meditate. Clear details are provided for the physical, mental and spiritual attitudes we should cultivate to properly engage the meditative state. Nithyananda informs us that the pose Sri Krishna describes is the ideal position to experience ultimate samadhi (spiritual bliss).\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nTECHNIQUE FOR SERENITY\n\nBhagavad Gita Chapter 6, verses 13-14\n\n11 Sep 2012\n\nLet's enter into the morning satsang, in Bhagavad Gita, 6th Chapter, Dhyana Yoga, 13th verse.\n\n                samam kaaya-shiro-greevam dhaarayan-nachalam sthiraha |\n\n                samprekshya naasi-kaagram svam dishash-chaanava-lokayan ||\n\nHolding the entire body, the neck and the head in a steady manner, look intensely at the tip of the nose without being distracted in any way.\n\nAgain, it is a technique. Please understand, in vedic tradition, one thing is banned. Never ever to comment on the technique. Only on philosophies, commentaries can be written. Never on the technique. Techniques have to just have to be followed. So, I will only give you the instruction from this verse.\n\nsamam kaaya-shiro-greevam dhaarayan-nachalam sthiraha |\n\n                samprekshya naasi-kaagram svam dishash-chaanava-lokayan ||\n\nHolding the entire body, the neck and the head in a steady manner, look intensely at the tip of the nose without being distracted in any way.\n\nHold the entire body, the neck and the head in a steady manner, look intensely at the tip of the nose without being distracted in any way.\n\nDon't be distracted.. this is the most powerful posture, the asana, in which you can experience Samadhi. I can't comment on this verse at all. Because He is so precise, I can only instruct. Hold the entire body, the neck and the head in a steady manner, look intensely at the tip of the nose.\n\nThe next sloka is also connected to this verse. So I will give the instructions from the next verse also.\n\nIn Bhagavad Gita, 6th Chapter, Dhyana Yoga, 14th verse.\n\n                prashaan-taatmaa vigata-bheehi brahma-chaarivrate sthitaha |\n\n                manaha samyamya macchittaha yukta aaseetha matparaha ||\n\nBeing serene within oneself, abstaining from apprehension, having subdued from the thoughts, intent on the vow of living like a God, intensely reflecting on Me, live your life, devoted to Me.\n\nMore than this, no direct instruction can be given by any incarnation for the human beings to save themselves. It is like a manual to save yourself. If the fellow who is struggling in the water says, \"eh! Why should I follow your instruction\" then what to do? The instructions are for you to save yourself. \"Why? Why should I follow? Are you the savior or what? You are God or what?\" then die, what to do? Instructions are for you to save yourself. Not for the captain to feel he is a big guy. So all of you understand, such a clear instruction, being serene within oneself, means stop having agitated mind. Agitated mind breaks your health now, brings hell in the old age; abstaining from apprehensions means free from the fear and greed. Having subdued the thoughts - having the reduced number of thoughts, beautifully Bhagawan uses the word, brahma-chaarivrate , following the vow of celibacy, intensely reflecting on me live your life devoted to me. On this word, brahmacharya, I wanted to conduct a complete full satsang, may be 2-3 satsangs continuously. So I will speak on this verse from tomorrow.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YA7xS1VkiaY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCCst2KnvmWdYAieOdcmpTbZI5ZUg","youtubeID":"YA7xS1VkiaY","viewCount":2948,"eventDate":"2012-09-24","duration":676,"likeCount":37,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"technique-for-serenity-ya7xs1vkiay"}}
