And, that starts giving you experience of You - Prajnaa - Individual existence; from then it starts growing. HDH explains further, If I have to visually describe - it is like a snake joyfully resting in Bodha of Shiva. It is left resting in the body, it just quietly goes to Muladhara Chakra, and happily goes to rest to Paramashiva Bodha.\nBetween the ages of 0 to 3 - the Naga mani gets evolved in that snake. The idea I exist, wakes up in your bio energy. Then it is called Prajnaa. The first evolution development happens in your bio energy kundalini snake which is feeling life from head to toe - end to end is alive. The feeling you feel I exist, that Prajnaa is Nagamani develops on forehead as self effulgent as shining golden diamond.\nThe various evolutionary stage of your Bio energy - first it evolves as I exist by the age of 3, then develops I want this and that by the age of 7, manifests physical maturity roughly before 14, Psychological maturity by 21. Natural flow of evolution. At one point it just stops the capacity of reproducing in your body. Moopa. And then it just goes back to root of spine to rest and leaves your body is death. In this at any point in time in life, if you had INITIATION - then it goes and touches the Sahasrara Chakra, based on spiritual practice - it stays on Sahasrara or various conscious levels or you absolutely get enlightened or you go to Kailasa for further transition based on the quality of your existence during your lifetime. \n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
