When we align ourselves, our relationships and \n\neverything else to Advaita, we will begin to understand how everyone, who is \n\npart of our life, is also part of us. We will discover that the more we establish \n\nourselves in the space of Advaita, the more life becomes smooth, victorious and \n\nsuccessful!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\n\nToday is UGADI. In Karnataka and Andhra, we celebrate the Hindu New \n\nYear. I bless all the devotees from Karnataka and Andhra. Let everyone have \n\nauspicious, blissful life. In Vedic Tradition, we have two calendars: Solar and \n\nLunar. One based on the Moon, and one based on the Sun. Today, the New \n\nYear starts based on the calendar which functions on Moon. My blessings to all \n\nthe devotees and the people of Karnataka and Andhra!\n\nToday, I will expand on \"The Space of Advaitha and Living\". \n\nAnd, today also is the Phoenix Temple's fifth anniversary! My blessings to the \n\nPhoenix Temple! Phoenix-Kanchipuram! Special blessings to all the founding \n\nmembers! I sincerely bless with all my Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility \n\nand Enriching: Let everyone associated with the Phoenix Temple be blessed \n\nby the presence and blessings of Nithyanandeshwara! Let all of you have \n\nall the auspiciousness, and let the Nithyananda Sangha happen in Phoenix-\nKanchipuram, and cause all your realities! Thathaasthu!\n\nToday is New Year for Maharashtra also. Gudi Padwa! My blessings to all the \n\npeople and devotees from Maharashtra!\n\nThe Space of Advaitha! Please understand, the more and more you establish \n\nyourself in the Space of Advaitha, the more and more life becomes smooth, \n\nvictorious, successful. \n\n.......\n\n One good thing, thanks to Einstein, Physics is moving towards the pure non-dualistic truth. But still these \n\npsychologist fellows are not completely moving. But the social media is nicely \n\npunching holes in their argument. \n\nListen! Don't believe the idea these psychologists put in your system that only \n\nif you transform your thought-current you can be complete, you can rest in \n\npeace. No! Just organize your thought-trend; that is enough! From morning \n\nwaking up to night falling asleep, your every day, if you align it to Advaitha, \n\nthat is enough. \n\n.......\n\n\nNo, you just try that for eighteen minutes, then you will understand how raw a \n\nform of tapas it is! Kundalini awakening, Yoga, meditation, Kriya, everything \n\nis great as long as it leads you to experience the non-dualistic truth, Advaitha \n\nSathya, Advaitha Poorna, Advaitha Jnana.\n\nSo, I wanted our whole Sangha -- please listen -- the whole Sangha, whether you are a Thanedar, Mahant, or Kothari, Shrimahant, whoever you are, align \nall your relationships with everyone to Advaitha. If there is a problem that the other person is not listening to you, first see you are not able to speak into your listening; that is why you are not able to speak into others' listening. See where you are not able to speak into your listening. Do that! My dream Sangha is: \n\nNever anybody will force the other person for anything; where everyone is able \n\nto speak into his own listening and others' listening. \n\nUnderstand, in every step of your life, infuse Shuddha Advaitha Sathya, the \n\npure Advaithic principles, pure Advaithic knowledge, pure Advaitha. Make it \n\nas thought-trend. Make it as thought-trend.\n\nThe essence of today's satsangh:\n\nDon't worry about your thought-current. Just make your thought-trend non-\ndualistic; that is all! The Facebook one-liner for all you guys: \"Don't worry \n\nabout your thought-current. Just make your thought-trend non-dualistic.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O4CsJllluTA/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"O4CsJllluTA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"what-is-your-thought-trend-o4csjllluta"}}
