The ability to achieve what you want in the inner or outer world or \n2. Just getting stuck in both the worlds. \n\n\"Wealth can be equated to the life energy you express. Everyone wants wealth, but they do not increase the life energy in them to the level they want it.\nSo be very clear if you do not have wealth, don't blame anybody. You are not expressing life in you. Life energy is not happening in you. I can tell you wealth itself is not wrong. Your concept about wealth if it is correct and proper, not only it will not be wrong, it will be right.\"\n\nHe went on to present first few basic concepts about wealth properly. 1st when a man decides to create wealth, do not steal. Create wealth. You will have wealth and great fulfillment, and your energy will be towards creating wealth not destroying others. \n\nThe consciousness attitude which works towards creating wealth makes you non-violent because your whole energy becomes creative. Creating wealth brings tremendous interest in life & non-violence. \n\n\"If you have at least the goal of creating wealth, you will be creative -- your energy will be channelled properly. The 1st priority in your life should be for moksha -- enlightenment. Till that happens, the 2nd priority can be creating wealth -- not grabbing, robbing or stealing but creating wealth.\"\n\n\"Seekers always justify their poverty as their spiritual quality and innocence. Nonsense. They are stuck with the so called mentality of sick and broke. They are not seekers but sickers.\"\n\n\"The new smriti I am declaring very clearly now -- Not creating wealth is sin. Just like grabbing, stealing, robbing, accumulating wealth in wrong way is sin, same way, not creating is also sin.\"\n\nVedantis missed to give a right understanding about wealth to society. Right understanding about wealth is life. I wanted all of you to understand donating or doing charity is nothing wrong, sharing is nothing wrong -- great. But being cheated is something seriously wrong. \n\nLife's flow is work. If you are not creating wealth, all your work is happening in wrong direction. Awaken the creativity in you. Remove the hatred for work and creativity. \n\nHe went on to give exact techniques and process to create wealthy consciousness. \"First you need to create a wealthy consciousness which is ready to take the responsibility to create and sustain, which is ready to take the responsibility of being creative. eN Kriya is a direct technique, method, process for creating a wealth consciousness in you.\"\n\nHe is also creating the technique and technology for creating a wealthy consciousness in you. That is the program eN Wealth. \n\n\"I will speak about how an enlightened man creates and sustains wealth.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/riTJd1GOfVA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBV9xvQF4tv9f2SdJLHaCG2RwFgjA","youtubeID":"riTJd1GOfVA","viewCount":135794,"eventDate":"2011-03-14","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"35"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-secret-of-wealth-creation-the-vedic-way-nithyananda-satsang-13-mar-2011-ritjd1gofva"}}
