On this auspicious day of Vedic New Year and 14th Anniversary of Nithyananda Sangha,   Paramahamsa Nithyananda blesses the Sangha to grow and serve the world forever. He intercepts into the last part of verse 8, where Consciousness is declaring Its Lordship. Consciousness is That Center from time eternal which is enriching the ages and each being ordaining onto them responsibilties, nature, actions, and  results, everything. He reveals the secret of all karma and results, which are allowed by Consciousness, and not because of karma itself. When Consciousness, in the form of an Enlightened Master intervenes, then our karmic chain of action, space, nature, responsibility, results – all can be directly changed, that is what we call as Miracles in the presence of Master. When we re-cognize ourselves as Pure Consciousness and surrender to It in the space of Advaita (Oneness), we can achieve liberation and get anything by doing and by non-doing. \n\nIsha Upanishad – Verse 8\nsa paryagāc-chukram akāyam avraṇam  asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham |\nkavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr  yathātathyato-arthān vyadadhāc-chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ || 8 ||\n\nToday’s Vakyartha Sadas, topic for spiritual explorations on truth is –  “It is Pure Consciousness, that from time eternal, has enriched the ages and each being, by ordaining desirable responsibilities onto them, as per their nature and space, and their actions and results thereof.” You need to read this translation again and again. Discuss, debate, intranalyze. Do not remember the bondages “from the body”, “through the body” as part of you. “From the body” means your diseases, you concepts of body, feeling good or bad about the body, about your skin color. “Through the body” means – I am son of somebody, sister of somebody, (etc.)...even disciple of somebody. No. Recognize you as Pure Consciousness.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/UYJN-G4FS8M/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"UYJN-G4FS8M","viewCount":12462,"eventDate":"2015-04-18","duration":3219,"likeCount":351,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"conscious-intervention-causes-miracles-uyjn-g4fs8m"}}
