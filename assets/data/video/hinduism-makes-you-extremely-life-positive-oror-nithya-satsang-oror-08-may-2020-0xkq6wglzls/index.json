Ahimsa means - absolute extreme life positivity in every level. For example, meat eating, not only violence done to animal from whom that meat was taken.  It is a violence done to your stomach, intestine, because your system is not designed for making meat as a regular food. The early human beings their system was able to digest the meat, because of their lifestyle.  Once the civilized, the so-called modern day, that civilized lifestyle started, when human beings were not living in the forest and hunting for food, when they started settling down, the whole body, mind, brain, everything started developing, that system, that new system you evolved for yourself is not designed for non-vegetarian food, meat as a regular food. So meat is a violence even on your system, not just the animal from whom you get the meat.  In every level, meat is violence and understanding this and bringing non-violence in every level with every context. The early human beings eating the meat cannot be the reason, for your evolved system, also forced to eat meat. In a way, there is nothing similar between the early human beings and the modern human body, modern human being.\n Celebrating the existence of each other - that is non-violence. Non-violence is the best way, best strategy even to stop Hindu Holocaust.\n\nHindu medicine system is the ultimate.  Whether the number of diseases they are able to diagnose or the number of diseases they are able to cure or the number of diseases they are able to heal, the number of diseases they are able to maintain without getting degraded and the long life, health, active lifestyle, they are able to provide in every level and their ability to keep you happy, blissful,  in every level Hindu medicine system is unimaginable.  Only one problem, no one can own it and exploit it, because all solutions are so open, you can adopt it on your own where you are.  It is not pill based, it is knowledge based, lifestyle based. It is not pill based, it is Charya - lifestyle based.  \n\nHinduism is the most non-violent, life positive knowledge tradition in every field.  History, Geography, Astrology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Mysticism, Religion, Economy, in every field, Administration, Social Justice, Law & Order, in every field, the field of education itself, nothing compared to the extreme life positive knowledge source of Hinduism.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
