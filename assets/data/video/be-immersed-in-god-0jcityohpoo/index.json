The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 15, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) shares with us the ultimate spiritual goal of the previous verses. When we master our thoughts, focus our attention beyond the distractions of life and melt into devotion, we are immersed in God and become One with Him. There can be no greater bliss than this.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome you all with my love and respects.\n \nToday, Successfully, the Nirahaara samyama - third level, eleventh day completing. Today is leventh day. So tomorrow. Tomorrow after morning satsang, all of you can start eating. You complete the Nirahaara samyama third level successfully.

Today it ends after the satsang. You can eat. Today we will give a break. Day after tomorrow, or tomorrow itself, we can start. Day after tomorrow, we will start the Nirahaara samyama level 2. Because, hundreds of Tamil nadu centers are also joining.\nOctober THE samyama -- There will be special kriyas and special ayurvedic and herbal juices for THE samyama participants. And, I am already ready with all those special kriyas. You may have to pay only for your special juices and accommodations and you will be medically continuously observed. Just for that, samyama itself is free. But for all these things, you may have to pay, it will be happening in Bidadi.

I am going to work on the list. Tomorrow I will finalize and initiate all of you into the kriya and the list. Because of this list, people who want to practice, I am delaying it one day. Tomorrow, I will initiate.\n \nLets enter into today's satsang. In Bhagavad Gita, sixth chapter, Dhyana yoga Fifteenth verse.:\n \nYunjan -nevam-sadaat-maanam\nyogi niyata-maanasaha\nShaantim nirvana paramaam\nmat samsthaa madhigacchati\n \nTranslation: In this manner the devotee whose mind is established, continuously connects with the higher consciousness, attains profound peace and becomes immersed in me.\n \nNow Bhagawan is in the mode of blessing. After giving a strong instructions; Usually I do that. If I give a strong dose, then I call that person, \"ok ok don't worry \"  and give one hug and say \"alright, alright\" . No, if that person is receptive. He receives that firing and really feels I should transform. so bhagawan is in the blessing mode. Beautifully he blesses.\n \nmat samsthaa madhigacchati\n \nHe becomes immersed in me. I tell you, This is the greatest blessing you can receive.\nWhen \"I say I will be with you\", Don't believe.\nWhen I say \"You will be with me\", believe only that  word.\nI will be with you for the whole world. But you will be with me is the real thing.\nUnderstand I am telling you, Wealth, Health, name and fame, life, body, mind, joy, pleasure -- When you ask, I will give all these things. But, whom I really really love, Somebody whom I really love, who has served his whole life dedicating himself or herself completely to me, If they come to me and ask me personally, \"Swamiji, What is the best thing you know in the universe? Can you give me that ?\"\nI tell you, I promise, I will give this only -- What Bhagawan calls as \"Matsamstha madhigachyate.\"\nBeing immersed in me. Nothing! Nothing is equivalent to this. Great saint, Tirunavukkarasar swamigal, from south india, even when he was put in prison, illegal imprisonment is the eternal law for incarnations, at least few days they are made to suffer.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0JCITyOhpOo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCPioji_zKIGrFKYUbD-oro9CHmXQ","youtubeID":"0JCITyOhpOo","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"be-immersed-in-god-0jcityohpoo"}}
