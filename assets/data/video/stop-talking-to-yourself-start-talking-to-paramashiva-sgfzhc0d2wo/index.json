IT MEANS, WHENEVER YOU ARE SAD, YOU ARE MADE TO FEEL YOU ARE GOING TO BE SAD FOREVER. \n\n*IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHATEVER I AM REVEALING TODAY, YOU WILL MANIFEST YOUR FUTURE JUST LIKE THAT. \n\n*PARAMASHIVA IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOTHER, HE MAKES YOUR FOOD IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT IS EASILY DIGESTIBLE. IT IS LIKE PARASHAKTI EATS ALL THE FOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE DIGESTED AND GIVES HER MILK TO YOU! IT MEANS THE WHOLE PARAMASHIVA JNANA IS DIGESTED AND JUST THE ESSENCE IS GIVEN TO YOU AS MILK. THAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ‘JNANAPAL’ (MILK OF ENLIGHTENMENT) GIVEN BY PARVATI TO JNANASAMBANDAR.\n\n*EVEN ONCE IF YOU COGNISE PARAMASHIVA IS REAL, AFTER THAT EVERY INCIDENT, EVERY DREAM IN YOUR LIFE WILL ONLY LEAD YOU TO THE REALISATION THAT PARAMASHIVA IS THE ULTIMATE. \n\n*ONLY WHAT YOU ‘COGNISE’ ABOUT YOU MATTERS, NOT WHAT YOU ‘FEEL’ ABOUT YOURSELF. \n\n\n*WHY DOES BABY JNANASAMBANDAR NEED TO ACCEPT THE MILK? HOW WOULD THE CHILD KNOW IT IS PARASHAKTI HERSELF? THERE IS NO REASON. THE ESSENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT IS WAKING UP TO THE HIGHER REALITY AND RULING YOUR LIFE AS ESHWARA FOR YOURSELF WITH MORE AND MORE POWERFULNESS. \n\n*ALL THIS CAN MANIFEST THROUGH ONE THING - TALK TO PARAMASHIVA. HE HAS TO RESPOND. LEARN TO UNDERSTAND HIS RESPONSE. IN BINARY LOGIC, WORDS ARE CONVERSATION. IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL LOGIC, SILENCE IS DEEPER CONVERSATION. WHEN YOU KNOW PARAMASHIVA IS REAL, AND INTENSELY TALK TO HIM, SOMETIMES HE MAY USE WORDS TO RESPOND TO YOU, SOMETIMES HE MAY JUST POUR SILENCE AND FILL YOU. THAT PEACEFULNESS IS THE RESPONSE TO YOU. WHATEVER HAPPENS INSIDE YOU AFTER TALKING TO HIM IS HIS RESPONSE TO YOU. DO NOT EXPECT WORDS AS PER BINARY LOGIC AS RESPONSE. LEARN TO UNDERSTAND PARAMASHIVA’S LANGUAGE. \n\nWHEN YOU START TALKING INTENSELY TO PARAMASHIVA, JUST REMEMBER THESE THREE: \nPARAMASHIVA IS REAL. \nSTART TALKING TO HIM. YOU CAN BE COMPLAINING, ENJOYING, ANGRY, THANKING, AGGRESSION, SURRENDER, SCREAMING, ANYTHING. KNOW THAT HE IS REAL AND GO ON INTERNALLY TALKING TO HIM. BEFORE SIPPING A CUP OF COFFEE, SAY, ‘SWAMIJI, HERE IS SWEET COFFEE, ENJOY!” \nHE IS OLDER THAN THE SUN AND FRESHER THAN THE BREATH YOU ARE TAKING INSIDE. \n\n*GO ON AND ON AND ON TALKING TO HIM. ONCE YOU FEEL YOU ARE DREAMING, AFTER THAT, EVEN IF YOU SLIP INTO THE DREAM, ALL THOSE DREAMS ONLY LEAD YOU TO WAKING STATE! \n\n*EVEN IF YOU DON’T WAKE UP AND FALL, AND SLIP INTO THE DREAM AGAIN, THAT EVERY DREAM WILL ONLY LEAD YOU TO WAKE UP. YOU WILL ONLY WAKE UP! \n\n*THE INDEPENDENT INTELLIGENCE WHO IS CREATING, SUSTAINING, RENOVATING, REJUVENATING, PULLING OUT OF DELUSION AND LIBERATING ALL OF US AND THIS UNIVERSE IS PARAMASHIVA AND HE IS REAL. HE IS AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM TO ALL OF US. \n\nCOGNISE THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND GO ON TALKING TO HIM. EVERY WORD YOU TALK TO HIM WILL BRING TREMENDOUS COMPLETION. STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF AND START TALKING TO PARAMASHIVA. \n\n*THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF TODAY’S SATSANG: STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF, START TALKING TO PARAMASHIVA. TALKING TO YOURSELF WILL BRING MORE FRUSTRATION, ANGER, INCOMPLETION. TALKING TO PARAMASHIVA YOU WILL GET PARAMASHANTA, EXTREME JOY, PATIENCE, ACTIVISM.\n\n*PARAMASHANTA GIVES YOU ACTIVISM IN LIFE. YOU ALL MISTAKE ACTIVISM AS AGGRESSION. PARAMASHANTA FLOWING IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION IS ACTIVISM.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SgfZhc0d2Wo/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"SgfZhc0d2Wo","viewCount":18489,"eventDate":"2020-01-09","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"stop-talking-to-yourself-start-talking-to-paramashiva-sgfzhc0d2wo"}}
