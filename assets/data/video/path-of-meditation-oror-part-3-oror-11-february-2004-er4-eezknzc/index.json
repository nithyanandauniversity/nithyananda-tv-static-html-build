Iyama: has five branches, ahimsa Non-violence, Astheya, non-stealing, Sathya, truthfulness, aparigraha, living with less, and brahmacharya, living like a God on planet earth, which includes celibacy.\n\nWhile Expressing the Quality of the Mind, Swamiji simply explains that ‘’Mind and energy is like a mother in law and daughter in law, if you try to make them silent, they will fight more. They both are possessed by each other in the same way your mind is possessed by the consciousness’’\n\nYou can say yes to only one person, not to two-people.In the same way, if you say yes to the mind you will say no to meditation. When you get solidified, you get integrated, when you let go of your mind, it goes it's own way.\n\nOnly when you live Sathya, truthfulness, in mind, word, and deed, is it authentic.\n\nThe Whole perspective of science towards the east and spirituality, is the last word of science, ‘’everything that exists is energy’’. Where science ends spirituality starts.\n\nWhen you live your life according to others’ choices or opinions you make your whole life a lie, and do not live the life you took birth for. At End, he also Explains about Varnashrama Dharma  - The Ancient Varana System, which was Beautifully holding the Structure of the Society in its Authenticity. And in course time it got diluted by an Anti-HIndu Elements. \n\nWatch, share and like our videos | Subscribe to our channel to be notified of the next upload. \n\n\nBe a part of the ultimate spiritual happening on Earth - Paramashivoham with HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam (16-day online program) \n\nSupport the World's Only Hindu Nation: https://kailaasa.org/join-kailaasa \nDownload the Nlighten App: https://get.nlighten.app Website and Social Media: http://www.kailaasa.org http://www.nithyananda.org ³¹http://www.nithyananda.tv http://nithyanandapedia.org/ http://www.innerawakening.org https://twitter.com/SriNithyananda \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Er4-eEzKnzc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Er4-eEzKnzc","viewCount":565,"eventDate":"2020-08-29","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"path-of-meditation-oror-part-3-oror-11-february-2004-er4-eezknzc"}}
