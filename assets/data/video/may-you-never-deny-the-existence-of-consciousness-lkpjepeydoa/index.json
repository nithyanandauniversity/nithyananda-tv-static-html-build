You build your life based on the blue print of your life. Blessed are those who carry the Completion in their inner space or trying for Completion…\"\" reveals Paramahamsa Nithyananda, expanding deeper layers of sacred truths from the Shanti Mantra, Peace Invocation chant of the Kena Upanishad on 3rd July 2016, Nithya Satsang, from Varanasi. \nAs one of the supreme peace mantra, this Shanti mantra teaches us to create Satsang in us, the company of truth, company of Completion, explaining the importance of being in community of people who have Completion in them or who are trying to live Completion or teaching others to have 'Completion' - the space of fulfilment; and teaches us to 'never deny the Existence of Brahman, the Cosmic Consciousness..\"\" Negating Existence, Brahman is likened to denying a board on which one writes 'there is no board.' or like denying the existence of a Father who has always nurtured us. \n\nHis Holiness insists on dropping such misunderstood less informed cognitions about Brahman; and gives the message to all through this Shanti Mantra to DECLARE:\n\nmāham brahma nirākuryām  – May I never deny the existence of Brahman. \nmā mā brahma nirākarod  – May Brahman never deny me or withdraw Its grace from me.\nDeclare this and carry this space inside you.\"\"\nDenying Existence is the mental setup of an atheist.  \n\nHe also reveals a profound component of the original Yoga System as revealed by Sadashiva, the Original Source of all Yoga Systems. Lord Sadashiva has revealed 'SHASTANGA - the six limbed yogic system' which is THE Original Yoga. In the SHASTANGA, the 5th limb or step is TARKA - which is intra-analyzing, arguing, debating with yourself or with a group the great truths of Life, till it becomes a foundation and base of your Life. And only with great Satsangis, the spiritual community tuned to Satsang, the company of truth such a 'Tarka' revealed by Sadashiva becomes possible. \n\nWith completion you can change the structure of your inner space. Morning Yoga and Night Completion – is the essence of Nithyanandam, the core teaching of Paramahamsa Nithyananda.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lkpjePEYdoA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"lkpjePEYdoA","viewCount":5693,"eventDate":"2016-07-10","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"may-you-never-deny-the-existence-of-consciousness-lkpjepeydoa"}}
