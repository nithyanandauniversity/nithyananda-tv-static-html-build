The words we utter to ourselves and others influence our health, thinking, actions, and all other aspects of our lives. When we use positive words, all our courage and energies will be awakened to fulfill those words. The Cosmos is on our side waiting to help us make our dreams reality. Let us declare our dreams, take responsibility for them, and watch them transform our lives!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n \nToday, Navaratri, the Srivari Brahmotsava, Venkateshwara Brahmotsava.\n \nVenkateshwara is gracing us in Sarva Bhoopala Alankara withthe  Sridevi and Bhoodevi.  He is dancing on  the Kaaliya or the snake, poisonous snake, and saving  the Gokula.\n \nAnd, as part of Navaratri Utsava, Devi is gracing us as Annapoorna with Lakshmi and Saraswathi, energy which feeds which resides as \"Anna\" in all of us.\nLet's enter into Nithya Satsangh.\n\nAgain I wanted to expand on power of words. Still that four important ideas are sitting in my inner space for more and more ideas to come out, more and more sacred secrets to come out, more and more truths to be revealed.\n\nPower of Words. I can give you one small example.  If you just go on uttering for a few days \"I am sick, I am sick, I am sick!\", and others also utter that words towards you, you will simply be sick.  I am giving you a negative example, because the negativity catches you very quickly, you catch negative examples very quickly.  Same way, if you constantly tell yourself \"I am healthy, I am healthy, I am healthy!\", and you use the same words towards others also, to others also  -- \"I am healthy, I am healthy,  I am healthy!\" -- I tell you, from somewhere the courage and energy and Kundalini will be awakened in you. The courage and Kundalini will be awakened in you, you will be really healthy. You need to know this truth which is a very important truth.  I wanted every one of you to know this truth.  \n\nListen, come to the space of listening. Danse suniya.\n\nAs natural programming, you tend to hold your words up and high.  So, when you give word to yourself and others \"I am healthy, I am healthy\", the extra Kundalini awakens in your system and holds your declaration as reality, holds your declaration high and up. Words you utter towards you, the words you utter towards others  are so powerful, you need to know, the words you utter towards yourself and others guides your thinking, the way your thinking flows.  \n\nJust decide, not even one year, six months and all, one month decide. Today sit and design, means write down what way you want you.  What way you want you, sit down and pen down and after penning down, next one month go on uttering the words as if you already become that.  For example, you decide you will become a wealthy, healthy, enlightened being, wealthy, healthy, enlightened being.  Everyone will think, 'Oh that is too much.'  \n\nFirst of all, you should know, you have a right to dream.   Cosmos does not make fun of you when you dream.  Please understand, Cosmos dreams along with you, it sympathizes with your  dream because you have a right to dream. Understand about that first.  May be your boss mocks at you when you dream. May be people who are jealous of you make fun of you when you dream.  \n\nHinduism gives you the complete right for your inner image, outer image, others' image and life image. That is why, even in our Sangha, I tell people, 'Practically that guy may be useless and a headache for the whole Sangha but he has the right to have the inner image, outer image, life image and others' image that he is an incarnation. He has the right, he has the right to have the inner image, outer image, life image, others' image that he is an enlightened being, he is an incarnation.  He has the right.  Hinduism does not make fun of your dreaming abilities.  \n\nI tell you, in any field, if dreams are not mocked only then growth will happen. When Wright Brothers wanted to fly, if people made fun of their dreams what would have happened? Of course, all of you should know that Wright Brothers were not the first to fly. Seventy years before the Wright Brothers, a Brahmin priest, in Mumbai, has built aircraft as per the Vedic traditions, Vaimanika Shastra and flew 3 Kilometre, 1,500 feet high in front of the Baroda Maharaja. In front of king and his court, he flew and safely landed and he has demonstrated. Unfortunately, when the British came, they killed that whole family in some false cases, pretext and stolen the aircraft and wiped the whole science out. They managed that. The whole thing is forgotten. No trail is left. You need to know these very important truths.  \n\nIf dreams are not allowed, if dreams are made fun of, growth is not possible.  The whole effort I am trying to do in my training is not to make fun of dreams but helping them to take responsibility.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S2nLWe7QCHY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDx5xddDybOjgZ3xUY1E9v0stvf8Q","youtubeID":"S2nLWe7QCHY","viewCount":46096,"eventDate":"2013-10-08","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"cosmos-is-waiting-to-fulfill-your-dreams-s2nlwe7qchy"}}
