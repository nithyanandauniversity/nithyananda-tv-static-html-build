Singing The Glory Of Krishna...","slug":"true-love-and-compassion-are-powers-singing-the-glory-of-krishna-qo7cctncpoe","description":"9 AUGUST 2020\n\n*ALREADY THE KRISHNA JANMASHTAMI HAS STARTED!\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM KAILASA:\n\n*THE ABSOLUTE COMPASSION, ABSOLUTE LOVE, MANIFESTS WITH THE COSMIC VISION ABOUT LIFE.\n\n*ALREADY KRISHNA JAYANTI MOOD HAS STARTED COSMICALLY. EVEN THOUGH WE WILL BE CELEBRATING IT TOMORROW AS PER THE COUNTRY TIME - 11TH AUGUST IN INDIA.\n\n*IF YOUR VISION EXPANDS, YOU OOZE, RADIATE ABSOLUTE COMPASSION AND LOVE WHICH IS POWER. NETHER COMPASSION NOR LOVE IS WEAKNESS. BOTH ARE POWER. DELUSION IS WEAKNESS. LOVE AND COMPASSION COME FROM THE POWER OF THE COSMIC VISION.\n\n*WHENEVER YOU MANIFEST POWERS, SUDDENLY YOUR BEING BECOMES MATURE AND IT STARTS RADIATING MORE AND MORE LOVE AND COMPASSION. I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THAT VERY GOOD POWER MANIFESTORS ARE ABSOLUTE NONVIOLENCE. THEY FEEL EVERYTHING RELATED TO VIOLENCE IS IRRELEVANT.\n\n*WHEN I RAISE MYSELF TO THE EXISTENCE WHERE MY ENEMIES CANNOT ATTACK OR HARM ME ANYMORE, THEY BECOME IRRELEVANT. THEY ARE NO MORE ENEMIES!\n\n*THAT IS THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE. I JUST MAKE MYSELF, MY LIFESTYLE, SPACE, MISSION, ABSOLUTELY UNREACHABLE FOR THE ENEMIES, OVER! THEN THEY BECOME IRRELEVANT TO MY EXISTENCE AND THEY ARE NO MORE ENEMIES!\n\n*WHEN SOMEBODY IS IRRELEVANT TO YOUR EXISTENCE, WHY WILL YOU EVEN REMEMBER THEM AS ENEMIES?\n\n*THE SIMPLE SECRET IS: EXPAND YOUR VISION, THAT'S ALL!\n\n*ONE EXAMPLE: EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS NITHYA - ETERNAL. ALL THE GOOD YOU DO IS ETERNAL. IT COMES WITH YOU FOREVER. SAME WAY, ALL THE BAD YOU DO COMES WITH YOU FOREVER.\n\n*THE SECRET TO DROP THE SUFFERINGS FROM THE BAD IS DROPPING THAT PATTERN. IF YOU DECIDE TO DROP THAT PATTERN DUE TO WHICH YOU DO BAD THINGS, ALL THE BAD THINGS OF THE PAST LOSE POWER OVER YOU; THEY JUST DIE; ALL THE BAD KARMAS JUST BURN. THE MOMENT YOU DROP THE PATTERN, KARMA IS ALSO BURNT.\n\n*SAME WAY, AT ONE POINT IN YOUR LIFE, YOU NEED TO BURN EVEN YOUR GOOD THINGS. IF YOU DO DAANA, SACRIFICE OF YOUR GOOD THINGS, IT GETS BURNT LIKE HOW KARNA GAVE ALL HIS PUNYA TO KRISHNA.\n\n*IN YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE TO BURN BAD AND GOOD, BOTH. IF YOU BURN ONLY BAD AND ENJOY ONLY GOOD, YOU CAN ENJOY. THAT IS ALSO YOUR FREEDOM.\n\n*WATCH TODAY’S SATSANG 3 - 4 TIMES BECAUSE I AM GOING TO REVEAL MANY OF THE COSMIC VISION - THE REALITY OF LIFE.\n\n*FIRST THING: EVERYTHING IS NITHYA - ETERNAL. IF YOU CHERISH ENMITY, ANGER, VIOLENCE, DO SOME ACTIONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A UPPER HAND, DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM IT.\n\n*BEING A GREAT DEVOTEE, ARJUNA GOT VISHVARUPA ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS. BUT KARNA HAD VISHVAROOPA DARSHANA AND IN THAT SPACE HE WAS GIVEN LIBERATION!\n\n*KARNA MOKSHA IS NOT AN ORDINARY JOKE! KARNA MOKSHA IS THE ABSOLUTE COMPASSION OF KRISHNA. KRISHNA IN HIS ELEMENT OF COMPASSION IS KARNA MOKSHA.\n\n*HOW MUCH KARNA ABUSED KRISHNA JUST TO PLEASE DURYODHANA. DURYODHANA ABUSING KRISHNA, EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS, BUT KARMA IS SUCH A CHARISMATIC CHARACTER. WHEN HE ABUSES, IT IS REAL ABUSAL.\n\n*EACH INCARNATION HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL QUOTA WITH A VETO POWER TO GIVE LIBERATION TO ANY KIND OF BEING. KRISHNA HAS DECIDED TO GIVE LIBERATION TO KARNA FOR VARIOUS REASONS. BECAUSE HE HIMSELF PLANNED AND TOOK THE SURYA KAVACHA FROM KARNA’S BODY TO PROTECT ARJUNA, HE DECIDED TO LIBERATE HIM.\n\n*A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH KARNA IS, HE HAS DONE SO MUCH OF PUNYA BY DAANA.\n\n*THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS, PURPOSES WITH DHARMA, DAANA AND CHARITY IN HINDU TRADITION. THERE ARE SOME KIND OF CHARITIES DONE TO KEEP THE CONCEPT AND VALUE OF CURRENCY ALIVE. IF YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL CURRENCY IS NOT REACHABLE AT ALL AND VERY DIFFICULT TO GET, CURRENCY WILL LOSE IT’S VALUE. IF TOO MUCH IS AVAILABLE ALSO IT WILL LOSE ITS VALUE. IT WILL BE LIKE YOU WILL HAVE TO CARRY BILLION DOLLARS TO THE PETROL BUNK. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BILLION DOLLAR NOTES.\n\n*TO KEEP THE GREED OF THE COMMON MAN ON CURRENCY ALIVE BUT NOT TO MAKE TOO MUCH AVAILABLE, AND TO MAKE HIM WORK TOWARDS THAT FALSE IDEA OF CURRENCY, THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY IS KEPT, AND THE ACTIONS DONE FOR THAT IS CALLED “DHARMA”.\n\n*IN LARGE YAJNAS, KINGS WILL DO CHARITY. WHOEVER COMES IS GIVEN. THAT IS ACTUALLY THE WAY OF KEEPING CURRENCY'S VALUE ALIVE. WHATEVER THE KING DECIDES SHOULD BE VALUED IN THE COUNTRY. HE WILL DO THAT AS DHARMA. IT IS DHARMA WITH THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THE VALUE OF THAT CURRENCY ALIVE IN THAT SOCIETY.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4206258866128598","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qO7cCTncpoE/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"qO7cCTncpoE","viewCount":3579,"eventDate":"2020-08-09","duration":4270,"likeCount":153,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"true-love-and-compassion-are-powers-singing-the-glory-of-krishna-qo7cctncpoe"}}
