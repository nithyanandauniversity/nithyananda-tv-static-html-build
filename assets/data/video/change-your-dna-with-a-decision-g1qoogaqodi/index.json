Your cognition should decide to live!” Our decision against life is SDHD (self-doubt, self-hatred and self-denial). All decisions against life are rooted in fear and the wrong belief that we will not be able to live. Let us not allow anti-life decisions inside us; no situation can make us powerless. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will enter into the second verse of Ishavasya Upanishad.  Please chant along with me:\n\n \n\nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\n\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\n\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\n\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n\nListen to the translation:\n\n“One should desire to live in this world for hundreds of years, all the while doing his deeds dispassionately as sanctioned by the scriptures, and treating them as his offerings to Eshwara, the quintessential Supreme Lord, the Lord of the whole Creation.  In this way, the deeds done by you shall not cling to you, the deeds will not cause their good or bad effects upon the doer of those deeds, simply because they are being done with the doer mentally convinced that he has not done them, he is not intellectually and mentally committed to these deeds, or they are done without his claiming any rights over the fruits of those deeds.  There is no other way by which a man can free himself from the bondage created by the deeds.”\n\nI will give you the translations of some of the scholars, and then give you my translation, and, of course, above all, the interception from the Upanishadic rishis.\n\nPlease understand, exactly this verse means:  You should LIVE!  Your cognition should decide to LIVE!  Understand?\n\nOne of the biggest problems all human-beings have, please listen, whether you don’t have money, enough money in your bank, or you don’t have enough excitement, inspiration to run your life, whether you don’t have enough money to run your life in the outside world, or you don’t have enough energy to run your body, you don’t have enough energy to run your mind, whatever you don’t have, please be very clear, it is side-effect of some of your decisions NOT TO LIVE.  Always support life.  You decide at some points, ‘Better not to live.  Instead of living this kind of a life, better not to live.’  Please understand, you should always think, ‘I will live in a better way.  Wherever I need to transform, no question of “better not to live than living in this way”.’  Whether your body does not have energy to get up, or your mind does not have enough excitement, whatever you may think you lack is nothing but the side-effect of the decisions you did in your past AGAINST LIFE.  So, through this verse, Upanishad declares: Always, always, decide FOR LIFE!\n\nListen!\n\nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\n\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\n\nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\n\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\n\nAlways, always, always, at any moment, decide FOR LIFE!  Your decision against life is SDHD – Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial.  All your tiredness, physical tiredness, mental boredom....  Actually, physically when you feel bored, that comes as tiredness; mentally when you feel tired, that comes as boredom.  And, all pain is suppressed anger!  Understand, whenever you become angry, you become violent and decide against life.  Whenever you choose “FOR LIFE”, your anger melts down into love and compassion.\n\nAny decision, please understand, even people who attack you, who cherish enmity towards you, you should never decide against their life; never decide they should die or they should suffer.  \n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/change-your-dna-decision-1#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/G1QoOgAQodI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"G1QoOgAQodI","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"change-your-dna-with-a-decision-g1qoogaqodi"}}
