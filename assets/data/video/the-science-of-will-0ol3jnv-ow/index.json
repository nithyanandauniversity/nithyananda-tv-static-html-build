This glorious declaration by the Upanishadic Rishis is the 'declaration of WILL\"\" forming the science of WILL. His Holiness reveals that the one core truth that the whole Hindu tradition accepts indisputably, be they from the Shakta, Shaiva, Kaumara, Ganapatya, Saurya, Jain, Buddha traditions or any of the 6 Darshanas of Hinduism is the sacred sound – AUM, the cosmic vibration and the sacredness of 'cows'. This Shanti Mantra or peace invocation begins with AUM, and makes a declaration of WILL, which fully integrates us and enriches (āpyāyantu) with MATURITY, STRENGTH, ENERGY.  \n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda enters into the deeper meanings of this verse with the essence of MATURITY. He defines: Maturity means being integrated to your WILL. Maturity does not mean you become handicapped; you become filled with strength and energy. Revealing the sacred moments from his childhood, He narrates how He had tuned Himself to the Sannyasa life at age 6 by declaring to His Guru and integrating his whole system which became matured to the decision of Sannyasa.\n\n\nShanta Mantra\naum āpyāyantu mamāṇgāni vākprāṇaścakśuḥ\nśrotram-athobalam-indriyāṇi ca sarvāṇi |\nTranslation: Aum.
