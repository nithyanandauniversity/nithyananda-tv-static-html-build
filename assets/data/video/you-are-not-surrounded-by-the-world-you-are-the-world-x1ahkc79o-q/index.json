PLEASE TAKE IT.\n\nF IS THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF BHU LOKA\nG - CONSTANT\nM - MASS OF OBJECT 1\nM2 - MASS OF OBJECT 2\nR - DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO OBJECTS\n\n*THE CONSTANT IN BHU LOKA IS ‘NITHYA’ IN TAPOLOKA. NITHYA IS CENTERED ON YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS. CONSTANT IS CENTERED ON MATTER. THE CONSTANT IN BHU LOKA IS CENTERED ON SOMETHING EXTERNAL. IT DOESN’T CHANGE AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR COGNITION. BUT ‘NITHYA’ IS MORE PERMANENT, ETERNAL THAN CONSTANT, AND ROOTED ON YOUR CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE!\n\n*THE WHOLE CONSTANT OF GRAVITY THEORY CAN CHANGE ONCE IN A FEW BILLION YEARS BECAUSE THE WHOLE BHU LOKA CAN BE WIPED OUT AND LIFE CAN START NEWLY, BUT NITHYA WHICH IS CENTERED ON YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS MILLION TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CONSTANT, AND IT IS NOT CENTERED ON MATTER BUT CENTERED ON YOU!\n\n*ANYTHING WHICH YOU DECIDE AS REAL INSIDE, BECOMES YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS. IF YOU DECIDE ‘PARAMASHIVA IS REAL’, THEN THAT TRUTH BECOMES YOUR NITHYA - THE CENTER OF YOUR EXISTENCE. THEN THE LIFE AND DEATH CYCLE TAKES YOU MORE AND MORE TOWARDS THE TRUTH ‘PARAMASHIVA IS REAL’.\n\n*THE CONSTANT OF BHU LOKA IS DEPENDENT ON MATTER. BUT NITHYA, THE CONSTANT IN TAPOLOKA, IS DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU DECIDE AS REAL. THE GOOD NEWS IS: YOU HAVE THE CONSCIOUS FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT AS REAL. WHAT YOU DECIDE AS REAL BECOMES YOUR GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT IN TAPOLOKA.\n\n*EVEN IN PLANET EARTH, IF YOU DECIDE ‘PARAMASHIVA IS REAL’, HE BECOMES YOUR GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT, AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU BECOMES TAPOLOKA. YOU ARE NOT SURROUNDED BY THE WORLD, YOU ‘ARE’ THE WORLD. THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE LIVING YOUR LIFE CAN BECOME TAPOLOKA, BHU KAILASA!\n\n*IT IS THE INDIVIDUAL CONSCIOUSNESS, PRATYAKATMA CHAITANYA, THAT DECIDES WHICH LOKA HE WANTS TO MANIFEST.\n\n*IN ALL OUR TEMPLES OUTSIDE INDIA, ONLY IF YOU CAN GET MILK FROM ISKCON GOSHALA, YOU CAN DO ABHISHEKAM TO THE DEITY WITH IT. OTHERWISE, GO FOR PLANT-BASED MILK LIKE SOYA MILK.\n\n*AGAIN AND AGAIN I WANT TO OFFER MY RESPECTS AND REVERENCE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISKCON. THEY ARE SO SINCERE TO HINDUISM. I AM ENAMOURED BY THEIR LOVE AND RESPECT FOR HINDUISM AND SRI KRISHNA. I WANT ALL OUR DEVOTEES TO LEARN THE INTEGRITY, LOVE AND RESPECT FOR HINDUISM AND SINCERITY, THE LOVE FOR THE ARCHAVATARA, FROM ISKCON AND BHAGAVAN SWAMINARAYAN’S SAMASTHA - BAPS.\n\n*CONSTANT IS THE PRINCIPLE BASED ON MATTER. NITHYA IS THE TRUTH BASED ON CONSCIOUSNESS. IF YOU DECIDE ‘PARAMASHIVA IS REAL’, THAT BECOMES YOUR NITHYA.\n\n*DECIDE: ‘I GIVE MY INTEGRITY TO MY ULTIMATE REALITY. LET MY LIFE EVOLVE THROUGH EVERY WAY TO THAT ULTIMATE REALITY, TO EXPERIENCE ONENESS WITH THAT REALITY.’ YOU WILL SEE, YOUR UPS, DOWNS, MOOD SWINGS, EVERYTHING WILL GET ALIGNED TO THAT DIRECTION!\n\n*NOTHING CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM WHAT YOU DECIDE AS NITHYA. EVERYTHING WILL ONLY ALIGN YOU MORE TOWARDS WHAT YOU DECIDE AS NITHYA.\n\n*I AM CLEAR: PARAMASHIVA IS MY LIFE'S NITHYA - THE ULTIMATE EXISTENCE, BEING, TRUTH. THE ULTIMATE IS REAL. HE IS MY NITHYA.\n\n*HE IS FORM, FORMLESS, BEYOND FORM AND FORMLESSNESS, BEYOND THE PRINCIPLE OF FORM AND FORMLESSNESS AND ALL FORMS!\n\nEQUATION:\nF = G(M1*M2/R2)\nYOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS COMPARISON SLIDE AND STUDY WHAT I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN.\n\n‘G’ IS THE CONSTANT IN TAPOLOKA WHICH IS NITHYA.\n‘M1’ IS ‘THE ROOT PATTERN’ WITH WHICH YOUR IDENTITY STARTS FUNCTIONING.\n‘M2’ IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES OR THE INTENSITY WITH WHICH THE PATTERN IS REPEATED CONSTANTLY.\n‘R’ IS THE BIO MEMORY OF WHAT YOU DECIDE AS YOUR CORE EXISTENCE\n\nFOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY DECIDE YOU ARE A DISCIPLE, DEVOTEE OR ONE WITH PARAMASHIVA. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DECIDE ANYTHING YOU WANT. IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOUR QUALIFICATIONS. IT IS JUST THE CONSCIOUS DECISION.\n\n*IF YOU DECIDE YOU ARE ONE WITH PARAMASHIVA, THEN YOU ARE PULLED TOWARDS TAPOLOKA. IF YOU UNDERSTAND THIS TODAY, THEN INFORMATION ITSELF BECOMES ENLIGHTENMENT!\n\n*EVERY TIME YOU DO COMPLETION, THE INTENSITY WITH WHICH THE PATTERN REPEATS REDUCES, AND THE INTENSITY WITH WHICH YOUR IDENTITY FUNCTIONS WITH THE ROOT PATTERN REDUCES. SO DO MORE AND MORE COMPLETION.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/x1AHKC79o-Q/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"x1AHKC79o-Q","viewCount":9300,"eventDate":"2020-02-04","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"you-are-not-surrounded-by-the-world-you-are-the-world-x1ahkc79o-q"}}
