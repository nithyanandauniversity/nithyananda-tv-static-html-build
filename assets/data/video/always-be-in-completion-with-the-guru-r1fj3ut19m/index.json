We need to beware of SDHD or self-doubt, self-hatred, and self-denial as they continually try to destroy these Four Truths, abusing the whole science of enlightenment! Giving in to SDHD is self-destruction -- giving up on ourselves! But luckily existence gives us the Guru who is always there protecting the Four Truths, helping us to destroy SDHD!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nI'll continue to expand on the characters of Mahabharata, concept of Kalpataru, Self-Denial, Self-Hatred, Self-Doubt patterns.\n\nPlease understand, Dhritarashtra -- Self-Doubt -- attracts Self-Destruction as a companion -- Gandhari. Self-Destruction always looks like sacrifice. Please listen, any sacrifice out of incompletion will only be self-destruction; it will not be tapas.  Kunti is also sacrifice, but out of completion.  Gandhari is also sacrifice, but out of incompletion.  The Kunti and Gandhari are complete opposites.  Sacrifice out of completion is Tapas.  Sacrifice out of incompletion is self-destruction.  Listen, sacrifice out of completion is Tapas; sacrifice out of incompletion is self-destruction.\n\nIn those days, there were some sampradayas where physically they make men impotent to keep up their brahmacharya.  I am completely against it.  The psychology should evolve, parasite patterns should be burnt, they should reach the space of brahmacharya.  That is what is sacrifice out of completion.  Physically if they are made impotent, that can never be called Tapas.  So, please understand, sacrifice out of completion is Tapas, sacrifice out of incompletion is self-destruction.\n\nSelf - doubt Dhritarashtra naturally attracts self-destruction -- Gandhari -- as the wife, companion.  Then both of them give birth to hundreds of self-denial.  Understand, hundreds of self-denial patterns!  When the self-denial is born, it will not have life.  When the self-denial is born, it will not have life.  It becomes hundreds of patterns.  That is what exactly happened when Duryodhana was born.  He became hundreds of self-denial patterns.  \n\nLook into your life, self-denial will never be alone.  It will have hundreds of patterns, so that from all sides you are attacked, you are cornered.  \n\nWhen the self-denial is born, you have a choice to complete with it immediately, but self-doubt will not allow you to be completed.  Dhritarashtra did not allow Duryodhana to be killed even though they all know Duryodhana's birth is going to be inauspicious for the whole country.  \n\nVidura is the initiation into Completion.  Once in a while, knowingly or unknowingly, you do get initiated into Completion.  Some where you listen to some spiritual principles, concepts, truths, but your self-doubt will never allow you to trust the power of Completion.  Your self-doubt will never allow you to complete with power of Completion.  And Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial, they are so cunning, again and again they will show to the world  Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching has nothing to offer you,  they themselves are pauper, they won't be able to offer you anything.  Self-Denial, Self-Hatred use all the cunning methods to take away everything from Integrity and Authenticity.  You are made to believe as if you are standing with Integrity and Authenticity, you will be only a loser.  But who is the ultimately who is the loser?  Self-Denial and Self-Hatred!  \n\nI sincerely recommend every one of you to watch the Mahabharata serial.  If you watch the Mahabharata serial and come for satsangh, you will understand completely what I am saying.  I thank the whole team which is doing this Mahabharata serial for doing such a great service to Bharat.  The layers and layers and layers and layers of socio-political personalities of Mahabharata is so beautifully portrayed by this team with so much of hard work.  I appreciate their hard work for portraying all the characters so beautifully.  And I really, really appreciate the team.  And I wanted all of you to watch that Mahabharata so that when I am describing the different characters you will understand more deeply.  \n\nTapas naturally aligns with the different powers of Nature and gives birth to Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching.  Kunti connects with Surya, Indra, Dharma -- means the Yama Dharma -- Vayu,  Ashwini Kumaras, and gives birth to  Pandavas.  But Self-Doubt joins with Self-Destruction and gives birth to Self-Denial patterns.  Understand, Self-Denial tries its best in every possible way to destroy Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching, but the power of the Guru -- Krishna -- again and again and again protects the Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-r1Fj3ut19M/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAKZh-zbapw1u9pCCtqK3gIMalKVw","youtubeID":"-r1Fj3ut19M","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"always-be-in-completion-with-the-guru-r1fj3ut19m"}}
