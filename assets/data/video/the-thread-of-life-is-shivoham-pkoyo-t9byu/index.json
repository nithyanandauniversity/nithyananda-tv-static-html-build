But the subjective truth comes directly through the Master during the time of initiation. It is the most powerful way in which Shivoham, the Advaithic space, is transmitted to us.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI’ll expand today on the difference between “Subjective Truth” and “My World”.  \n\nListen! Whatever happens in “The World”, if you form opinions, analyse with your incompletions, the by-product is “My World”.  “My World” also happens inside you; Subjective Truth also happens inside you. You need to know the difference. This difference will solve thousands of questions people have about their behaviour and enlightened master’s behaviour.  No they think, ‘Many times how I think, like that Swamiji also thinks.  Why what I think is wrong and what he thinks is right?’\n\nUnderstand, “My World” is from the context of incompletions. Because of your incompletions, reality, perception, all this changes. But, Subjective Truth is from the context of initiation from the Master.  See, what you think as you, Inner Image, Mamakaara, and how you project yourself to others, Ahankaara, these are all “My World”.  It is based on your incompletions. But the Shivoham is given to you as a truth, as a initiation from your Master. That is not dependent on your incompletions; it is from the initiation. The ultimate truth, ultimate reality, transmitted to you based on the initiation, is Shivoham. Ultimate truth transmitted to you based on the initiation, Shivoham, is Subjective Truth.  \n\nI’ll repeat now. Listen! Catch it carefully! The ideas you develop, the concepts you develop, the cognition you develop based on your incompletions is, concepts you develop, the ideas you develop based on your incompletions is “My World”.  But the cognition you develop by the initiation from the Master – Shivoham – which is based on Complete Completion, is “Subjective Truth”. What starts happening in you due to incompletion and changes, destroys you and your life outside, is “My World”.  What starts in you because of initiation, and elevates your life internally and externally, is “Subjective Truth”.\n\nI’ll define “Subjective Truth”.  Subjective Truth is Ultimate Truth which is truth even when you are not able to grasp, even when you are not able to perceive, even when you are not able to receive, but you start working on it like a seed; how the sand works on the seed, the land works on the seed, and the seed becomes tree, the initiation given to you is like a seed.  You work with that constantly and the seed becomes tree, the seed becomes tree, understand.  \n\nSubjective Truth, the more and more you nurture, cherish, strengthens you. “My World”, the more and more you nurture it, weakens you. Subjective Truths create your reality.  Incompletions moves you out of even the reality that exists. Moving you out of even the shared reality is “incompletions”.  Creating your, manifesting your ultimate reality is “Subjective Truth”.  Subjective Truth is manifesting your ultimate reality. Incompletions is the myth; but Subjective Truth is mythology, understand?  When I use the word “mythology”, actually it is too poor a word. Because there is no other word in English, I am using it.  I should use the word “Purana”.  “Purana” is Subjective Truth. All the Hindu scriptures are Subjective Truth. They are not born out of incompletions. They are Subjective Truths.  They are Subjective Truths.  \n\n”Subjective Truths” and “incompletions”, the difference between these two needs to be thoroughly internalized by you. More and more you contemplate on incompletions, you will become weaker and weaker. The more and more you remember the Subjective Truth, you will become stronger and stronger. With incompletions you will become weaker and weaker. With Subjective Truths, you will become stronger and stronger. Whatever weakens you by more remembrance is “incompletion”.  Whatever strengthens you by more remembrance is “Subjective Truth”.  “Aham” is incompletion.  “Shivoham” is Subjective Truth. The more and more you remember the “Aham”, it leads to incompletions.  The more and more you remember “Shivoham”, it leads to experience strength.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- http://nithyananda.org/video/thread-life-shivoham#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PkoYo-t9BYU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"PkoYo-t9BYU","viewCount":3009,"eventDate":"2014-11-29","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-thread-of-life-is-shivoham-pkoyo-t9byu"}}
