The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 10, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) shares the sacred secret of how to live an enlightened life. When we are attached to our identity, we judge the world through the lens of our beliefs and prejudices. We create imaginary wars with people around us, thinking we know how they feel about us. Nithyananda gives us a technique to shed these fantasy relationships. Approach someone we think of as an enemy and sit quietly with them, asking them to share their honest feelings about us. Repeat this with someone we think of as a friend. We will learn the spiritual skill of impartiality: of treating both friends and enemies with equal respect and compassion.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita, Chapter 6: Dhyana Yoga, 10th Verse\nSept 8, 2012\n \nYogee yunjeeta satatam aatmaanam rahasisthitah l\nEkaakee yatachittaatmaa niraasheeraparigrahah ll\n \nThe one who feels the same towards an affectionate person, a friend, an enemy, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful one, the unfriendly, the noble one or a sinner!\n \nYogee yunjeeta satatam aatmaanam rahasisthitah l\nEkaakee yatachittaatmaa niraasheeraparigrahah ll\n \nThe translation:\n \nThe contemplative sage, saint having subdued his thoughts and character, his identity being free from desires with an attitude of renunciation, seated within oneself in aloneness, should continuously connect with the higher consciousness by unclutching.\n \nThe Jeevan Mukta having subdued his thoughts and character, identity, being free from desires with an attitude of renunciation, seated within oneself in aloneness, should continuously connect with the higher consciousness by unclutching.\n \nNow Bhagavan actually enters into the straight technique of unclutching.\n \nYogee yunjeeta satatam aatmaanam rahasisthitah - Having subdued his thoughts and identity being free from desires!  I tell you, subduing identity, subduing thoughts anybody can do.  It is not a big thing,   I tell you.  Thoughts can be reduced very easily with any simple technique. \n \nI know one sadhu. I have seen him day-in and day-out in Rishikesh. Whole day the only work he will do is wash his Kamandalu, the water pot.  It will be just shining. But you know the most funny thing? He has  less thoughts, very less thoughts.  His only focus is that his Kamandalu should not become dirty.  His water pot should not be dirty. That's where everything stops.  Any simple technique, even technique like washing your water pot can bring your thoughts down. That's not a big thing! \n \nSubduing the identity means thoughts are food, identity is person who eats.  Who eats should be subdued not just the food.  The identity grows, expands with thought. Reducing thoughts is not a big thing. Actually, without touching the identity, reducing the thoughts is very easy.  I have seen a yogi standing on his one leg for more than 12 years, in Kumbhamela during my Parivrajaka time. He really had a very reduced thought state.  But unfortunately the attention people give because of his Tapas has made his identity swollen like his leg, one leg, on which he was standing.   One leg on which he was standing was swollen, same way because the attention he enjoys from people, his identity was swollen. \n \nIt is very easy to have less number of thoughts, if your identity is getting more and more boosting.  If the identity is not touched, it is very easy to have less number of thoughts.  When the identity is touched, almost like a honey comb, how if the honey comb is touched, the bees come out, like that thoughts come out.  I have seen many of my ashramites.  They will really be having very less thoughts, calm, composed.  Just poke at their identity once.  People whom they don't like or there is a hatred, just one word from that person like a honey comb -- Buzzzzz! All the thoughts will come up. The whole puss will come out. \n \nIf your identity is not touched, having less number of thoughts is not a big thing. Once Kuppammal, my Mentor and Guru, she was really worthy of that word - Vibhuthanandapuri. She told me \"You need to learn to drop the identity\".  15 year old boy, what will I understand?  I said \"You tell me what I should   do, I will do\". She gave me a begging bowl and told me \"Go around and beg all over the city and come back\". \n \nMy grandfather, he is a big guy in that village. So, till death he was the head of the rice merchants' association.  See, rice is the biggest business in that area. For 3 states that one city supplies rice.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qb986FzF7xw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCvm9uxfCRNlYF6_0wDnVHBUBJs6g","youtubeID":"Qb986FzF7xw","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"identity-is-confused-reality-qb986fzf7xw"}}
