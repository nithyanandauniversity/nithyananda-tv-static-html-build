Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals many profound secrets such as the differences between logic and emotion, love as a cure all, the true value of zero and how the “gray area” is detrimental to human life. Through the truths of the Upanishads, Paramahamsa Nithyananda is giving us the truths of life!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n \nI AM READY!  Let us start the mantras!\n \nJust before entering into the mantras, our Publications Department has done an amazing work of already releasing the e-book, “Upanishads Demystified – Living Advaitha Series”, my introduction to Upanishads. My introduction to Upanishads, all these days’ satsanghs are already transcribed and available as an e-book. You can download it freely from our website – www.nithyananda.org. “UPANISHADS DEMYSTIFIED – Akashic Records about Upanishad – Living Advaitha Series”, the book is already ready, thanks to Publications Department! Give a good hand to Publications Department!  Blessings to Publications Department!  They are really, really active, and doing a wonderful job!  Great!\n \nLet me enter into the Sutras today. Let us invoke the presence and blessings of Mahadeva and all the rishis.  Let them all bless us to vibrate in the same frequency so we understand and experience the Upanishads!\n \nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते |\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||\n|| ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ||\n \nOm Poornamadhah Poornamidham Poornaath Poornam Udhachyathey |\nPoornasya Poornamaadhaaya Poornamevaavasishyathey ||\n|| Om Shanthi Shanthi Shanthih ||\n \nOm, the Yon is Fullness, this!\nFullness from Fullness doth proceed!\nWithdrawing Fullness’s Fullness off,\nEven Fullness then itself remains!\n (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)\n \nNow, the introduction, understand. \n \nA normal man’s life in the waking state runs based on logic. How much ever you condemn logic, you cannot drop it, understand? Even after realizing the state of God, if I feel like sneezing, I have to pick up the kerchief and wipe my face. It will not come by itself and wipe my face.  The waking state of human life is bound by logic, it functions by logic. Logic is the law of waking state of human life.  But, human life is not just waking state as we are all made to strongly cognize.  That is where we need to understand. \n \nListen!  When the emotion interferes in any equation, logic loses its base.  For example, two plus two is four (2 + 2 = 4) is logic. But, in a painting, the paint you use and the canvas put together is not the painting. That is not equivalent to the painting. Listen! You cannot even come to the logical conclusion the amount of force used by the painter on the brush which reached the canvas and made the paint stick to the canvas. No! The amount of paint used, the amount of force used, the canvas used, all put together can never be the equivalent of the painting, because of the component of “emotion” involved. That is why even the country law gives huge punishment if the crime is a heinous crime. All murderers don’t get hanged. Only if it is the “rarest of the rare”, they get hanged. What decides the “rarest of the rare”? The emotion involved in it! It is like a child is killed. A child is raped and killed. Naturally, there is too much of emotion involved in it. The child has a future; it can’t defend itself; it can’t protect itself.  Defenceless!  Life!  It has a future!  When that is harmed or killed, naturally it becomes a “rarest of the rare” crime.  Understand, in any field, when the emotion is involved, logic cannot be taken to the end, and that does not give the right result.\n \nEmotion is the “Smell of Consciousness”.  That is why your dreams can never be logically analyzed or concluded.  Suddenly you will be sitting with somebody, whom you never want to see in your life in the waking state, and having breakfast!\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:-video/upanishads-%E2%80%93-love-mental-cure-all#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JJQDGUkDdy0/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"JJQDGUkDdy0","viewCount":9715,"eventDate":"2015-01-16","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishads-love-is-a-mental-cure-all-jjqdgukddy0"}}
