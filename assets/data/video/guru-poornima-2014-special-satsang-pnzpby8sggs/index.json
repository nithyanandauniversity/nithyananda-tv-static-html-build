Today is Guru Poornima the Guru's day and the one day of the year such an offering is possible.  He told us to create whatever we want from the truths of Advaitha. He told us to let living Advaitha be the space from which we operate and let authenticity be the context from which we operate. Then he offered an open invitation to all to becomea declared committed part of the sangha.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nMy message, this Guru Poornima's message, today's message for all of you: LIVE ADVAITHA!  Understand, living Advaitha, live Advaitha means, create whatever you want from the power of Advaitha.  Understand, Advaitha is a simple basic truth, simple basic truth, like \"Sun rises in the morning in the east\". You cannot go on debating about it. The direction in which the sun is rising, we call that as east. The time the sun is rising, we call that as morning. These are all simple factual understandings. So, Advaitha is also a simple factual understanding. If you go on debating, 'How can you say it is east?  How can you say it is morning?', you can be wasting your life. You can be wasting the beautiful space of sun till it settles down in the west in the evening. \"Sun rises in the morning\" is not a debatable subject; it is a fact on which you need to strategize your life.  Align your house windows, doors, if you want the sunlight, sun rays.  Wake up at that time and make yourself available to the world; or, whatever you want from the world, receive, do all that interaction, because it is day time.  \"Sun rises in the morning in the east\" is a statement on which you need to plan your strategies about life, fact based on which you need to plan your life. It is not a subject to be debated.  It is a subject on which you plan your life strategy. Advaitha also is not a subject to be debated; it is the facts on which you need to plan the strategy of your life. I don't even want to use the word \"truth\", because it is loaded. I will use the word \"fact\", \"simple fact\".  Advaitha is a simple fact on which you can strategize your every-day activity, every-day action. \n \nPlease understand, all of us are completely connected in the space of oneness. I am not saying all of us are one; I am saying all of us are in the space of oneness. All of us are in the space of oneness!  If you see goodness outside, you are in the space of Completion inside. If you see bad things outside, you need to complete inside. Go on...go on...go on...go on! Let every decision you make, let every thought you entertain, every word you utter, every word you utter, every action you do, let it be based on Advaitha. Let it be completely based on Advaitha.\n \nUnderstand, \"Living Advaitha\" means, your self-drive, your inspiration, your energy, your experience, your intelligence, everything operates from Advaitha, from the truth and fact, sacred secret of the oneness. When I speak, in my speech, I will use only the words \"we\", \"us\".' -- even this simple decision will go on reminding you if you take it from the context of oneness. If you take this simple decision from the context of oneness, even this simple decision will be going on reminding you the Advaitha. It will be going on reminding you the Advaitha.\n \nEvery day morning when you wake up, align yourself to the oneness.  Every thought, every action, bring more and more Advaitha into it.  Please understand, don't freeze yourself.  Don't think you have grown up, now nothing more can be done, transformation is not possible.  No!  Every day the possibility for you to build a new personality, new body, new mind, new being is available, open.  That availability is what I call \"life\".  Using that availability and making Advaitha as a strategy, building a new body, new mind, new personality, new words, new thoughts, new actions, is what I call \"Living Advaitha\". Living Advaitha! Living Advaitha!\n \nWhatever you want to achieve in your life, let your authenticity be the context from which you operate. I tell you, the one and only way, the best way to live Advaitha is to become part of the Sangha. I tell you, just become part of the Sangha; I will constantly be evolving you, transforming you.  Becoming part of the Sangha is nothing but you saying a big \"YES\" to me, that's all! Becoming Thanedar or Kothari or Mahant or Shrimahant is nothing but you declaring you are ready to be directly trained by me, you are ready to be directly raised by me, you are ready to be directly transformed by me.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNzpBy8sgGs/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"PNzpBy8sgGs","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"guru-poornima-2014-special-satsang-pnzpby8sggs"}}
