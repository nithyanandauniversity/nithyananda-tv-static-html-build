Volume 8","slug":"stop-the-hindu-holocaust-volume-8-7lkbzqe00nc","description":"28 April 2020\n\n*TODAY, FOURTH DAY OF THE CHITHIRAI BRAHMOTSAVAM CELEBRATION.\n\n*TODAY IS ALSO ONE OF THE IMPORTANT HAPPENING FOR KAILASA. THE 292ND GURU MAHASANNIDHANAM OF THE SHYAMALA PEETH SARVAJNAPEETHAM PERFORMED ALL THE PRELIMINARY RITUALS NEEDED FOR CORONATING ME AS THE 293RD GURU MAHASANNIDHANAM OF SHYAMALA PEETH SARVAJNAPEETHAM. CORONATION HAPPENED ON THE 5TH DAY OF THE BRAHMOTSAVAM. THE PRELIMINARY RITUALS WERE DONE ON THE 4TH DAY DAY - TODAY. SO WE ARE EIGHT YEARS COMPLETED AND ENTERING NINTH YEAR!\n\n*TODAY, NITHYANANDESHWARI PARASHAKTI MEENAKSHI IS GRACING IN SARVA ALANKARA ADORNED IN AMLANA MALA AND IN THE SWARNA VAHANA AND NITHYANANDESHWARA PARAMASHIVA SOMASUNDARESHWARA ALONG WITH PARASHAKTI MEENAKSHI IS GRACING IN SARVA ALANKARA GRACING IN SWARNA RISHABHA VAHANA.\n\n*TODAY IS ALSO ADI SHANKARACHARYA’S JAYANTI. HE IS THE ONE WHO REVIVED THE SHYAMALA PEETH SARVAJNAPEETHAM. SHYAMALA PEETH SARVAJNAPEETHAM WAS REVIVED MULTIPLE TIMES. SO ADI SHANKARACHARYA WAS ALSO ONE OF THE REVIVORS. HE WAS THE 117TH GURU MAHASANNIDHANAM WITH THE TITLE “SHANMATHA STHAPANA DESIKAR:\n\n*TODAY IS ALSO SRI RAMANUJACHARYA’S JAYANTI. WE WILL BE CELEBRATING ALL THESE UTSAVS TODAY. LET US OFFER ALL OUR WORSHIP.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM KAILASA.\n\n*STOP THE HINDU HOLOCAUST! I WANT LOT OF MISINFORMATIONS ABOUT HINDUISM TO BE CLEARED AND THE FULL BREADTH AND DEPTH OF HINDUISM TO BE UNDERSTOOD.\n\n*PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ONE OR TWO COMPONENTS OF HINDUISM AS HINDUISM. SOME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ONLY THE LIFESTYLE - CHARYA PADA - LIKE IF YOU ARE NONVIOLENT, TRUTHFUL, VEGETARIAN, DOING YOGA - ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF HINDUISM, AS HINDUISM. SOME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ONLY THAT AS HINDUISM.\n\n*THERE ARE SOME WHO NOT ONLY THINK CHARYA PADA IS HINDUISM, THEY THINK EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT HINDUISM. THAT IS WHERE THE WHOLE PROBLEM STARTS.\n\n*WE NEED TO KNOW THAT HINDUISM IS A GREAT SPIRITUAL SCIENCE - SUBTLE, OTHER WORLDLY, BUT DEFINITIVE SCIENCE, WHERE COSMIC BEINGS EXIST IN KAILASA MUCH BEYOND ANY OF YOUR UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT GOD. THEY ARE MORE INTENSE POWERFUL BEINGS THAN ALL YOUR UNDERSTANDINGS, IMAGINATIONS PUT TOGETHER ABOUT GOD. INFINITE NUMBER OF SUCH BEINGS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY IDEA YOU HAVE ABOUT GOD, EXIST IN KAILASA.\n\n*MANIFESTING THEM IN DEITIES OR IN LIVING INCARNATIONS IS POSSIBLE. HINDUISM HAS MASTERED THE SCIENCE. THERE ARE SOME GREAT SPIRITUAL SCIENCES UNIQUE TO HINDUISM.\n\nMANIFESTING THE COSMIC BEINGS IN DEITIES - ARCHA AVATARA AND IN LIVING INCARNATIONS - NIJA AVATARA IS POSSIBLE. IT IS KRIYA PADA.\n\n*ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS, THE MODERN DAY HINDUS AT LEAST FOR THE PAST 100 YEARS DID NOT SEE THIS MANIFESTATION IN NIJA AVATARA IN LARGE SCALE. SRI RAMAKRISHNA DID IT. TIRUKKOVILOOR JNANAGIRI SWAMI DID IT, BUT THEY DID IT TO A SMALL GROUP OF THEIR DISCIPLES. MASS DID NOT GET TO HAVE THOSE DARSHANS.\n\n*WHEN RAMAKRISHNA GAVE KALPATARU AND SAMADHI DARSHANS, NOT MORE THAN 2-DIGIT PEOPLE ENJOYED IT. IT WAS ALWAYS A SMALL GROUP. SO UNFORTUNATELY HINDUS FORGOT THAT THIS IS THE SCIENCE FROM HINDUISM.\n\n*KRIYA PADA OF HINDUISM NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, HINDUS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE STARTED DENYING. ONE CHUNK OF HINDUS AGREE THAT COSMIC BEINGS CAN BE MANIFESTED IN ARCHA AVATARA BUT THEY ARE NOT READY TO UNDERSTAND OR ACCEPT THE COSMIC BEINGS CAN BE MANIFESTED IN NIJA AVATARS - INCARNATIONS.\n\n*BUT KRIYA PADA OF VEDAS AND AGAMAS ELABORATELY EXPLAIN THE WHOLE SCIENCE OF MANIFESTING THE COSMIC BEINGS IN ARCHA AVATARA - DEITIES AND NIJA AVATARA - LIVING INCARNATION.\n\n*UNFORTUNATELY, THE NEO-HINDUS WHO ARE NOT READY TO UNDERSTAND THAT COSMIC BEINGS CAN MANIFEST IN ARCHA AVATARA - DEITIES, BECOME ANTI-TEMPLES AND ANTI-BRAHMIN.\n\n*I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF HINDUTVA GANGS - ANTI-HINDU AND ANTI-BRAHMIN.\n\n*SOME OF THE NEO-HINDUS, WHEN THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE THAT COSMIC BEINGS CAN MANIFEST IN NIJA AVATARA - LIVING INCARNATION, BECOME ANTI-GURUS. I HAVE SEEN EQUAL NUMBER OF ANTI-HINDU AND ANTI-GURU HINDUS.\n\n*I SHOULD SAY, I AM PERSECUTED MORE BY THE ANTI-GURU HINDUS THAN THE ANTI-HINDUS. IF I SEE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ATTACK ON ME, SURELY IT IS ANTI-GURU HINDUS DOING MORE THAN THE ANTI-HINDUS ITSELF.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7lkBZqE00Nc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"7lkBZqE00Nc","viewCount":2274,"eventDate":"2020-04-28","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"29"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"stop-the-hindu-holocaust-volume-8-7lkbzqe00nc"}}
