And the ultimate, lifestyle book, that was delivered by Mahadeva to Parvati, is the Kamika Agama. He sums up the Vedic Tradition in just one word and that is Live!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will directly enter into the Upanishads.\n \nToday, I will enter into the second verse. Please chant along with me.\n \nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \nThe translation says:\n \n“Even while doing deeds here, one may desire to live a hundred years, Thus, on you, not otherwise, that this is it, the deed adheres, not the man.”\n \nListen! This verse is the essence of Vedic Tradition. Again and again and again insists, Vedic Tradition is all FOR LIFE! If I have to put the whole Vedic Tradition in one word: LIVE!  That’s all! LIVE! Live so powerfully, so clearly, that all your patterns, engrams, fears, don’t find any place; you are just radiating; you are just overflowing.  LIVE!  LIVE!  LIVE!\n \nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \nThis verse is actually a “blessing”. See, the Upanishadic rishis expect you to achieve everything just by the first verse: \n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥ 1 ॥\nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Maa Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nOver!  They don’t expect you to have any doubt. The kind of a space they are carrying, rishis feel with this verse you are enlightened! Now you just need a blessing. A disciple who is enlightened needs the blessing from the guru. Actually, this verse –\n \nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \nthis verse is a “blessing”. \n \nSomebody was telling me the other day..... One Swami came and met me. That Swami was telling me, he heard some of the great scholars, pundits, telling him....it seems they asked this Swami who came to meet me, ‘What right this Nithyananda has to comment on Upanishads? Where has he studied Sanskrit Who is his guru teaching all the bhaashyaas? Who taught all the bhaashyaas?’, all these scholarly questions! Scholarly questions! \n \nThis Swami, it seems, asked only one question, ‘I am also seeing his satsangh. You are also seeing his satsangh. Come on, let us have an open discussion. Tell me honestly, all his words, does it make sense or not?’\n \nIt seems, that pundit who was questioning, he put his head down and, ‘It make sense, no doubt.  But, how can he speak? Who taught him? There should be a parampara! There should be! He does not have any guru who taught him different bhaashyaas, commentaries, vaarthikaas, teekaas.  Then how can he comment on Upanishads?’\n \nTo that Swami, I gave only one answer: ‘Yes, I have not formally studied. The gurus who taught me don’t even know how to chant the mantras with the so-called perfection.  And they were not Sanskrit scholars. They taught me a little bit whatever they can.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/upanishad-live-forever-blissfully#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zV5Z_5ZiA3E/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"zV5Z_5ZiA3E","viewCount":4580,"eventDate":"2015-02-06","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishad-live-forever-blissfully-zv5z5zia3e"}}
