Even the Guru cannot interfere with what we feel our subjective truth is; they can only guide us and give us techniques to encourage our chosen truth to further evolve us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nSo, I will continue on ‘SHIVOHAM’. \n\nShivoham!  Shivoham!  Shivoham!\n\nThe word ‘Subjective Truth’, when the world knows to respect the Subjective Truth, this becomes a place to live.  When world learns to encourage others’ Subjective Truth, this becomes heaven!  The most unique point of Sanatana Hindu Dharma: Everyone’s Subjective Truth is encouraged.  Everyone’s Subjective Truth is enriched.  Everyone is asked to live the Subjective Truth.  Of course, hypocrisy is never allowed.  Hypocrisies were weeded out.  But, never the freedom to interfere in the Subjective Truth was given; even to Guru!  Understand, even I do not have right to interfere or demolish your Subjective Truth!  If you feel oneness with Mahadeva, Shivoham is your Subjective Truth, I have no right to disrespect it.  I have right only to initiate you.  I don’t have right to interfere.\n\nFor example, if you suddenly say, ‘I am Mahadeva!  From today I am going to keep Trishula and Kapaala (Trident and Skull), and I am going to eat only in the Kapaala and Trishula!’, I have no right to interfere.  ‘From today I am going to live like Mahadeva!’, I have no right to interfere.  I have only the right to explain if there is some hypocrisy.  If there is some hypocrisy .... For example, if you say, ‘No, I am not going to do any work like Mahadeva!’, then, if you are joyful like Mahadeva, no problem; you don’t need to work.  Your very joy will enrich the world.  But if you are hypocritical, ‘Only when it comes to work I will be like Mahadeva.  I will not do anything.  And whole day I will be lying and sleeping.’, then I have the right to expose your hypocrisy to you.  But I don’t have a right to interfere in your Subjective Truth.  I cannot say, ‘No, no, no, you are not Mahadeva!  You are a servant of Mahadeva, or son of Mahadeva, disciple of Mahadeva!’  I have no right, understand?  Even Guru has no right to interfere in your Subjective Truth in our Hindu tradition.  The only right denied to the Guru is interfering with the Subjective Truth.\n\nRamanuja’s guru was an Advaithi, great Advaithi; but he did not have legitimate right, dharmic authority to interfere with the Visishtadvaitha, Subjective Reality of Ramanuja.  Ramanuja’s guru was a great Advaithi; but he did not have the right, dharmic right to interfere with the Subjective Reality of Ramanuja which is Visishtadvaitha.\n\nAnd Govindapada (Adi Shankara’s guru), Gaudapada (Govindapada’s guru), they are such great Advaithis; they did not have legitimate right to interfere with the devotion, Subjective Reality of Adi Shankara.  He sang so many amazing verses on devotion!  Shankara is a great Advaithi, no doubt; but, whenever he want to experience the Subjective Reality of devotion – Dvaitha, Visishtadvaitha – Gaudapada and Govindapada, could not interfere.\n\nI tell you, whether it is your Duality (Dvaitha) or Non-Duality (Advaitha), or Visishtadvaitha, Advaitha, I have a right, Guru has a right only to expose your hypocrisy, inauthenticity, to you; but, even Guru does not have a right to interfere in your Subjective Reality. \n\nThere are tons and tons of evidences.  Chaitanya was initiated in the Advaitha Sampradhaya. He belongs to Puri Sampradhaya. His Sannyas name was ‘Chaitanya Puri’. But, his Advaithic guru was not able to interfere into the Subjective Reality of Chaitanya....into the Subjective Reality of Chaitanya. Not possible! \n\nUnderstand, with all the integrity and authenticity, and lot of joy, I am telling you, I am born in the tradition which respects everyone’s Subjective Reality, Subjective Truth. I am so happy this tradition not only allows, encourages everyone’s Subjective Truth to become reality.  See, the Subjective Truth is like a small lamp. When it is growing, growing, there is a possibility you can just blow and put it off. That blowing is stupid, fanatic preachings.  (Swamiji blows in the air)  Poof!  Nothing else exists!  Over!  And the Subjective Truth will be put off; the fellow is spiritually dead. \n\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/power-subjective-truth#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pVMB92RyUqI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"pVMB92RyUqI","viewCount":2175,"eventDate":"2014-12-05","duration":1663,"likeCount":40,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"power-of-subjective-truth-pvmb92ryuqi"}}
