By having completion with Advaitha, all the benefits promised by the science of Advaitha will become a reality in our life; we will literally be omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, moving everything.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLet’s enter into today’s satsangh.\n\nListen. Please listen intensely.  Listen carefully.  I am going to expand and explain this Mahadeva’s revelation: HAVING COMPLETION WITH ADVAITHIC PRINCIPLE, WITH THE ADVAITHA SIDDHANTHA, WITH ADVAITHA ITSELF.\n\nPlease understand, understanding, the principles of Advaitha is law of your life, that is the flow of your life, and having completion with it completely. Everything, all spiritual, religious processes on the Planet Earth, everything, all the spiritual, religious processes on the Planet Earth, whether it is building a temple or ashram, goshala, Veda Patashala, or doing Pranayama, Kriya, Yoga, Puja, Homa. It can be anything, any act but finally, to help you to make complete with the Advaitha, help you to experience Completion with Advaitha, understand helping you to live Dharma, Dhamma - I wanted all of you to understand the power of this spiritual truths.\n\nPlease understand, when you experience Completion with Advaitha, everything Advaitha promises will become reality in your life.  Ability to understand everything, ability to move everything, literally omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, able to understand everything, move everything, align everything as you want, that is what I call “Completion with Advaitha”.  With any principle, with any law of life, when you experience Completion, all the things promised through that principle becomes part of you.  See it is like if you are complete with your father and mother, whatever belongs to them belongs to you.  Whether it is social influence, contacts, money, knowledge, whatever is theirs becomes yours. Actually, in the young age, having Completion with father and mother deeply, at least till the age of fourteen, helps you to understand Completion, I am telling you. That is why I insist if the child is not in the gurukul – of course if he is in the gurukul he is learning Completion with the Cosmos itself - but if the child is not in the gurukul, if you are bringing up the child with you, this should be the basic condition: it should be all the time playing in your lap, whenever the child is with you in the house, whenever time permits; there should be tremendous friendliness and Completion.  \n\nMany westerners can’t understand when I say sometimes in my satsanghs and programmes, till I left the house, I used to always sleep in the same bed with my mother.  Westerners can’t understand.  In India it is a lifestyle!  The children always sleep with the mother or the father.  Even that word “sleeping with” has been polluted and corrupted.  I am telling you, children playing with the father and mother, spending time as much as possible, brings tremendous Completion to the kids and makes them understand what is Completion, how Completion empowers you, makes you strong.  \n\nWhen you experience Completion with Advaitha, everything belongs to Advaitha belongs to you, everything belongs to that Dharma belongs to you. Understand, everything belongs to Dhamma belongs to you.  Everything belongs to Mahadeva belongs to you.  Whether it is building a temple, or creating a Yantra, or using a meditation technique, whatever may be done, everything is done just to make you experience that great truth – Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham.  Everything is just to make you experience Shivoham.\n\nListen, in Vedic tradition we even use herbs, so many things to experience Shivoham, to experience the Advaithic Oneness, to awaken Kundalini. First time ever, I am going to reveal that science experientially to all of you in Cambodia Inner Awakening, using the yantras, herbs, mantras. Like Patanjali says, ‘Mani, Mantra, Oushadha’, using all three – Mani, Mantra, Oushadha – using herbs, yantras, mantras, to give you the experience of Shivoham.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/cambodia-%E2%80%93-transcendental-experience#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JoPyFEkTUho/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"JoPyFEkTUho","viewCount":2543,"eventDate":"2014-10-30","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"cambodia-a-transcendental-experience-jopyfektuho"}}
