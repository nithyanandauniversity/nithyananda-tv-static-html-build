THAT STUFF IS CALLED MAYA TATTVA IN VEDIC TRADITION. IT IS NOT THERE BUT IT IS THERE.\n\n*THE TIME AND SPACE DIMENSIONS DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENT OR BORDER. FOR EXAMPLE: IF TIME AND SPACE PUT TOGETHER IS 100 METERS OF CLOTH, THEN FOR SOME PEOPLE IT IS 60 METER IS TIME AND 40 METER IS SPACE. FOR SOME PEOPLE IT IS 30 METER IS TIME AND 70 METER IS SPACE. FOR SOME PEOPLE IT IS 98 METER IS TIME AND 2 METER IS SPACE. FOR SOME PEOPLE IT IS 2 METER IS TIME AND 98 METER IS SPACE!\n\n*THE TIME AND SPACE CONTINUUM AND THE WAY IT EXISTS AS REALITY FOR YOU IS NOT THE WAY IT EXISTS AS REALITY FOR OTHERS. THAT IS WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SOME PEOPLE FEEL, “O GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHY I NEED TO OPEN MY EYES!”\n\n*THE OUTER WORLD REALITY IS PERCEIVED BETWEEN CERTAIN FREQUENCIES. ONLY FROM 20 - 20,000 HERTZ, SOUND CAN BE PERCEIVED BY ANY HUMAN BEING. BELOW OR ABOVE THIS RANGE, WE CANNOT HEAR THE SOUND. IF YOU EXPERIENCED BEYOND THIS RANGE, IT IS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.\n\n*YESTERDAY, I SAW BHAGAVAN REDDY'S WIFE, SUPRAJA, WHEN I WAS GIVING THE SATSANG, SHE WAS GETTING INTO THE MOOD OF THE ANAHATA DHWANI! IT WAS A REAL EXPERIENCE!\n\n*JUST LIKE HOW SOUND BELOW 20 HERTZ AND ABOVE 20,000 HERTZ CAN’T BE HEARD BY NORMAL MAN BUT IT CAN BE HEARD BY EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITY, THIS REALITY WHICH ALL OF US ARE COMMONLY SHARING WITH THE WORD CALLED ‘WORLD’, IS ALSO BETWEEN CERTAIN FREQUENCY.\n\n*FOR EXAMPLE: THIS FREQUENCY OF SOUND, I WILL DESCRIBE AS 20 - 20,000 UNIT OF ‘MAYA’. I AM USING THE WORD ‘MAYA’ AS UNIT FOR REALITY. BETWEEN THIS RANGE OF MAYA, ALL OF US, COMMON HUMAN BEINGS, CAN EXPERIENCE IT AS A WORLDLY REALITY. BELOW 20 UNIT AND ABOVE 20,000 UNIT, IF YOU EXPERIENCE IT, YOU START MANIFESTING POWERS!\n\n*IF YOU UNCLUTCH INTENSELY, IT GOES BELOW 2O: PURE INTENSITY. ABOVE 20,000 IS PURE DEVOTION. BUT IN BOTH, YOU EXPERIENCE ONENESS - SHUDDHADVAITA SUKHABODHAM!\n\n*WHETHER YOU UNCLUTCH AND REACH BELOW 20 UNIT MAYA OR PRACTICE DEVOTION, FEEL CONNECTED AND REACH ABOVE 20,000, YOU EXPERIENCE THE SAME ONENESS.\n\n*IF I INITIATE YOU INTO POWER MANIFESTATION, THE WHOLE BODY, MIND STARTS GETTING GROUNDED IN THAT SPACE OF ONENESS, SHUDDHADVAITA SUKHABODHAM. WHAT YOU MANIFEST IS SHAKTI, NOT ORDINARY SIDDHI.\n\n*IN OUR POWER MANIFESTATION, THE MORE YOU PRACTICE, THE MORE YOU GET GROUNDED IN ENLIGHTENMENT. OUR KIDS, THE MORE THEY MANIFEST POWERS THE MORE THEY GET DETOXED, GROUNDED, PURE, SETTLED AND ENLIGHTENED.\n\n*WHENEVER MY KIDS THROW TANTRUMS, I WILL SOMEHOW CONVINCE THEM AND MAKE THEM DO POWER MANIFESTATION, EITHER THIRD EYE OR AKASHIC READING. AKASHIC READING IS BEST BECAUSE WHEN KALABHAIRAVA LANDS, HE CLEANSES THE HOUSE THOROUGHLY. HE IS THE ACID WASH FOR CONSCIOUSNESS. SO WHENEVER THEY DO AKASHIC READING, THE KIDS IMMEDIATELY GET SETTLED, GROUNDED SO MUCH! KALABHAIRAVA IS THE BEST GOD!\n\n*HE GENERATES SUCH POWERFUL JOY, ENLIGHTENMENT!\n\n*LENGTH, BREADTH, DEPTH ARE THE KNOWN DIMENSIONS OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN AS PER MODERN SCIENCE. TIME AND SPACE ARE YET TO BE EXPLORED, YET TO BE FULLY KNOWN. THEY STILL REMAIN MYSTERIOUS FOR THE GRASP OF ORDINARY HUMAN MINDS. BUT THE LENGTH, BREADTH, DEPTH IS MOST COMFORTABLY, CONVENIENTLY UNDERSTOOD DIMENSIONS OF THE KNOWN REALITY, WORLD.\n\n*I AM DEVELOPING A SPECIAL SUPERBRAIN WHERE MY GURUKUL KID, JUST LIKE HOW THE SCIENTISTS ARE ABLE TO DECODE AND REVEAL EVERYTHING RELATED TO LENGTH, BREADTH, DEPTH, MY GURUKUL KIDS WILL REVEAL EVERYTHING RELATED TO TIME AND SPACE!\n\n*THAT IS WHY I INSIST ON NOT EATING OUTSIDE FOOD. ONLY GURUKUL FOOD, AADHEENAM FOOD - THE FOOD IS OFFERED TO DEITIES WHO ARE LITERALLY ARCHA AVATARAS, GODS!\n\n*THIS IS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE MY GURUS USED TO USE ON ME. THEY WILL INSIST I EAT THE FOOD OFFERED IN THE ARUNACHALESHWARA TEMPLE, OFFERED TO PARAMASHIVA. KUPPAMMAL USED TO DO REGULAR PUJA AND ABHISHEKAMS WHENEVER I AM GETTING TRAINED INTO NEW INITIATION, WHICH WAS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK!\n\n*THEY WOULD DO SOME TRAINING ON ME ONCE A WEEK. SOMETIMES THEY WILL TELL ME DIRECTLY, “THIS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR YOU BUT YOU NEED TO LEARN THE PROCEDURE SO YOU CAN TRAIN OTHERS AND REVIVE IT.”\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4270678106353340","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzkjKf5zTrM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBNHOVklcVh0L8RbtcMN20-WlRq8Q","youtubeID":"CzkjKf5zTrM","viewCount":3391,"eventDate":"2020-08-25","duration":3745,"likeCount":116,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasa-in-one-word-is-simple-hard-work-oror-25-august-2020-oror-czkjkf5ztrm"}}
