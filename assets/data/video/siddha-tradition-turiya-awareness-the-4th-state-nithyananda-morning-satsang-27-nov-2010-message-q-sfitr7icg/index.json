There are 5 states: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, fourth (state of awareness), and the 5th -- turiyatita (state of consciousness).\nDue to lack of words, he used the word \"fourth state\" for Turiya (awareness), and the 5th state -- turiyatita -- consciousness. In the five states, only the last 2 states are directly life based. All other states Swamiji claimed are dilutions of life.\nHe called the waking state a diluted version of life; the Dream state as opposite to life; and deep sleep as away from life. The 4th and 5th states are life based states. All other states are diluted, away and opposite to life.\nHe describes these states in the following way:\n1st -- Turiya Jagrat (awareness waking state)\nIn the state of turiya, you are in awareness state, and this world also will be seen. You will be able to have both. It is a state of complete joy and ecstasy.\n2nd AWARE -- DREAMING (TURIYA SWAPNA)\nIn the state of awareness, the appearance or creation of world, may, may not appear. This Aware --dreaming state, this world may appear but not like world, suddenly it will disappear, suddenly it will appear.. you will see very clearly it is melting down... like wave it appears and disappears.. melting down.. Swamiji actually went into this state in an attempt to describe it to the audience.\n3rd TURIYA SUSHUPTI (awareful sleeping)\nThis is a state of no thoughts in the awareness state. Sometimes during unclutching, you experience this. in Ananda Gandha, you experience this, completely no thoughts. You are there. The very identity about you disappears. The very idea about you disappears. Actually after this state, there is no return. Once you experience this state, you don't come back to normal state. Never ever, the ignorance can engulf you. This is one of the highest zones. \nTURITYA TURIYA (AWAREFUL AWARENESS)\nThis is the expansive cosmic consciousness. Realizing the expansive cosmic consciousness and it's innate nature... remains as I AM THAT, being as it is, this is what he calls Living Enlightenment, realizing the expansive cosmic consciousness is me and being in that state.\nToday he gave us technical knowledge of 4 states of 4th state (awareness). He will continue to explain techniques and right understanding to awaken the right states in your system in next session.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q-SfiTr7Icg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAAra-vvkU6uEjj8kXXl4efuMuF4w","youtubeID":"Q-SfiTr7Icg","viewCount":19045,"eventDate":"2010-12-02","duration":1319,"likeCount":279,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"16"},{"id":"25"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"siddha-tradition-turiya-awareness-the-4th-state-nithyananda-morning-satsang-27-nov-2010-message-q-sfitr7icg"}}
