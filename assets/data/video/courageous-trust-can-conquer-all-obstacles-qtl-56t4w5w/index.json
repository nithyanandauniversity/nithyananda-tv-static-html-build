The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In this morning's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 39, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) inspires us to invoke the power of shraddha in our spiritual practice. Shraddha is usually translated as \"faith\". Paramahamsa extends this definition to embrace \"courage\": the fortitude required to endure the pressures that push us into enlightenment. When we yearn for the enlightened state we feel a suffocation, a constraint that our present awareness is too small and too confined. With shraddha we can permit that suffocation to work on us, to burst us open like a seed sprouting into a tree. Paramahamsa gives us a technique to relieve the pressure: share our knowledge with others. This allows us to expand our boundary and release the sense of suffocation.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nSwamiji : Today's Satsang :  In Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter , Jnana Karma Sanyas Yoga, 39th verse\n\nShraddhaa-vaallabhate Jnaanam tatparaha samyatendriyaha I\n\nJnaanam labdhvaa param shaanthim achirenaadhi-gacchathi II\n\nTranslation : The person with the trust catches hold of consciousness. Beyond that he subdues the power of the senses. Having attained the state of consciousness very soon he acquires supreme auspiciousness.\n\nA person with shraddhaa ! shraddhaa ! The very word is so beautiful and powerful ! Courageous trust is what I call shraddhaa ! Unless the seed has the courage to be pressured by the sand and break open, it can never become tree. Same way, unless your nerves, your cognizing system, the system in which, system through which you take cognizance of life in your system, means through which you perceive, unless that goes through the supreme spiritual yearning pressure, the suffocation due to the insufficient feeling of your capacity to perceive. Please understand, the only difference between you and me is that I can perceive little more, deep into time and space. You can comprehend using your mind may be little bit from the past and little bit in the present and  little bit in the future and little bit happening around you. I can perceive little more in the past, little more in the present, little more in the future, little more in the outer and inner space, that's it! So the yearning to perceive more, suffocation of lower level of perception is the basic requirement for Enlightenment. Unfortunately when that happens, you give different reasons for that suffocation and run away. Actually when somebody comes into the organization and I awaken their Kundalini, the suffocation of insufficient perception only is awakened in them. But unfortunately they feel I think this suffocation is because of the structuring (department), because people don't care about me. They attribute to all outside and run away, escape. It is not because of any other person, it is because of your Kundalini awakening. When the Kundalini is awakened, the first thing will happen to you is you will feel the insufficient perception, the suffocation of insufficient perception. Shraddha is the strength to face the insufficient suffocation and break it, make it into a complete perception, your capability to perceive, your capability to expand.\n\n Bhagavan is hitting again and again on this same point last three verses. You can see clearly last three verses he goes on talking about 'spontaneous readiness for intense action'. Still that word is there in my tongue like a hangover of the sweet ! See if you eat some sweet you really like, at least for next 10 minutes you will have the hangover in your tongue. That word is so beautiful - Spontaneous readiness for intense action. Still that word there is in my throat like a sweet ! Now Bhagavan uses beautiful words Shraddhaa-vaallabhate Jnaanam. These three words are used in Vedanta again and again in many places. This three words are popular words, in Aatmabodha, in many of the Shankara literatures and the later Surshwarshwara's Vartikas and Bodhendra Saraswati's Teekas and many other post Shankara Vedantic literatures talk about this word Shraddhaa-vaallabhate Jnaanam. All you need is the courage to stand your own yearning, intense yearning. I tell you, seed has to feel the pressure, from outside the pressure of sand, from inside the pressure to become a tree. Only then it slowly opens up and becomes a tree. Same way, when somebody comes here to learn from me, to imbibe from me, the first thing I do I try to expand their perception, their capability to look into past, present, future, outer space and inner space. Please understand, if somebody is screaming at you, if you start immediately hating the person, your perception is too small in the outer space.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qtL-56T4w5w/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBXAuBEo1RmIUyvLGsIdXvPkgSbYw","youtubeID":"qtL-56T4w5w","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"courageous-trust-can-conquer-all-obstacles-qtl-56t4w5w"}}
