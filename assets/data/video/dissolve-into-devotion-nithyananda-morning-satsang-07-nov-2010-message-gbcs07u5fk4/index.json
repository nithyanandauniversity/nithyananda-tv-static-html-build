While doing research on the topic of devotion, Bhakti, Paramahamsa Nithyananda was surprised that no studies existed in the West on the concept of Bhakti. Lots had been done on the power of prayer, and its positive effect on illnesses, but no interest was shown about Devotion.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda was very clear; these two concepts are completely different. Prayer has its roots in the Western religious concept that there is one almighty God that created the universe.\nIn the Vedic tradition, God and the universe are not separate.  The whole consciousness decided to expand and enjoy itself, and so it became many.  The Ganges civilization knew all is consciousness, and to celebrate the very existence of consciousness.  The reason the Siddha style of healing is so effective is that it treats every cell and molecule in the body as an independent intelligence.\nThe understanding of God and the Universe is the distinction between devotion and prayer.  Bhakti flowers from the centre of the synchronicity of knowing we are one with the source.  When we understand the correct relationship between God, nature, human society, and ourselves, that we are all one, sacred sentiment occurs.\nWhen we don't understand the relationship of these four, only sentiment, flawed emotion, occurs. \nPeople who feel there is a God and a Heaven will feel cheated when they try to go there after death. Understand the Origin enjoys itself out of its own independent intelligence.  When this right understanding hits you, you will feel a great bubbling up in your heart and a huge load vanishes from your system.  That feeling is Bhakti, devotion.\nThe basis for Bhakti is non-suffering.  If you are suffering, get rid of it, unclutch from it.  No devotion can happen with suffering. From the base of non-suffering, anything emotion that wells up in you is sacred sentiment.\nTomorrow, Paramahamsa Nithyananda will continue with his discourse on sacred sentiment.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gBcS07u5FK4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCeM9bfA2DlbI7zTh7-XEMdc08hKw","youtubeID":"gBcS07u5FK4","viewCount":7508,"eventDate":"2010-11-15","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"23"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"dissolve-into-devotion-nithyananda-morning-satsang-07-nov-2010-message-gbcs07u5fk4"}}
