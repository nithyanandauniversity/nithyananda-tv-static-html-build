In this talk Nithyananda discusses how one deals with non possessiveness. He says that sometimes its as easy as just dropping that thing with no pain. The other side of the coin is where one feels pain and suffering while going through this non possessiveness. Nithyananda smiles and emphasizes that this is the most powerful master as pain and suffering purifies you. Its only when one goes through pain and suffering and then unclutches that one is liberated from pain and suffering of possessiveness.
