IT WILL NOT EVEN BE SKIN DEEP. IT IS ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY. THAT IS WHERE ME AND NEW AGE GURUS DIFFER! \n\n*I AM VERY CLEAR YOUR COGNITION NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED AND IT IS VERY EASY. THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS I HAVE! BECAUSE YOUR COGNITIONS ARE ‘YOUR OWN’ COGNITIONS, THEY ARE YOUR OWN PROPERTY, SO YOU EASILY DISPOSE, ALTER, CHANGE IT. THE COGNITIONS YOU CARRY MATTER. \n\n*MY WHOLE SHRIKAILASA EFFORT IS JUST TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE PARAMASHIVA FOR YOURSELF. \n\n*I AM TRYING TO CREATE AN ECOSYSTEM WHERE 1000S OF YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS TRUTH I AM TEACHING AND PRACTISE IT. \n\n*I AM GIVING THIS AS A SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE AND INSTRUCTION: LOS ANGELES, SAN JOSE, TORONTO, SEATTLE, OHIO AND ALL OUR TEMPLES - I WANT 100S OF FAMILIES TO SETTLE DOWN AROUND THESE TEMPLES, NOT AS COMMUNES BUT AS COMMUNITIES, NOT AS A GATED COMMUNITY WITH EXCLUSIVITY, BUT JUST LIKE REGULAR US CITIZENS, AS PART OF THEM. \n\n*EVERYONE SHOULD COME EVERYDAY TO THE TEMPLE AND ATTEND THE SATSANG. IT SHOULD BE A LIFESTYLE. IT IS 1000 TIMES GREATER THAN ATTENDING SATSANG FROM HOME. THE ENERGY IN THE DEITIES IN THE TEMPLE IS SO GREAT AND IT HAS THE GURU, LINGA AND SANGA! THE TEMPLE AWAKENS SUCH POWERFUNESS, INTENSITY AND DEPTH IN YOU. \n\n*I AM ANNOUNCING NEW SPIRITUAL POLICIES: THESE FIVE THINGS SHOULD BE IN ALL MY TEMPLES: \n\n1) ALL THE MAJOR DEITIES OF HINDU SAMPRADAYA SHOULD THERE IN LARGE SIZE - GANAPATI, SHIVA, DEVI, SUBRAMANYA, VISHNU, NAVAGRAHAS AND EACH GOD’S DIFFERENT INCARNATIONS LIKE RAMA AND KRISHNA FOR VISHNU. THE DEITIES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY THE DEVOTEES - LIKE COOKING FOOD, OFFERING ABHISHEKA AND SO ON. WHEN YOU DO THIS, SOMETHING WILL START HAPPENING INSIDE YOU. PARAMASHIVA WILL START MANIFESTING INSIDE YOU. I AM NOT SAYING HAVING PRIESTS IS WRONG, NO! I AM ABSOLUTELY FOR IT. EVEN IF I APPOINT PRIESTS FOR OUR TEMPLES IN THE FUTURE, I WILL BE MORE HAPPY IF DEVOTEES ACTUALLY RELATE WITH THE DEITIES - BOTH MEN AND WOMEN FROM ALL COMMUNITIES AND ALL GENDERS. EVEN IF THERE ARE PRIESTS, THEY CAN DO ONE KALA PUJA WHEREAS DEVOTEES SHOULD DO THE OTHER KALA PUJAS. THE GURU, LINGA AND SANGA START HAPPENING INSIDE YOU. \nOUR TEMPLES DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER, RACE, COMMUNITY, CASTE. IF YOU ARE INITIATED AND MAINTAIN VEGETARIAN LIFESTYLE IT IS ENOUGH. \nTHIS IS MY VISION OF SHRIKAILASA. I WANT EVERY USA CITY TO HAVE ONE KAILASA ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 10,000 HINDUS THERE (NOT INDIANS). ANYONE WHO IS INITIATED CAN START PRACTISING. WE SHOULD FOCUS AND MANIFEST THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM NECESSARY FOR THIS IN EVERY CITY.\nOUR TEMPLES SHOULD BE MORE A PLACE WHERE POWERFUL PRACTISING IS DONE. \nTHE DEITIES WE GIVE BIRTH ARE MADE PROPERLY AS PER AGAMA. THEY ARE CALLED ARCHAVATARA AND WE ARE MASTERS IN THIS FIELD. WE KNOW WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO THOROUGHLY. THAT IS THE UNIQUENESS OF SHRIKAILASA - NITHYANANDA’S PARAMASHIVA TEMPLES! \n2) POWER MANIFESTATION SHOULD GO ON IN ALL OUR TEMPLES WORLDWIDE. LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SHOULD BE BENEFITED BY THE POWER MANIFESTATION SCIENCE. IT SHOULD BE TAUGHT BY COMMITTED CELIBATE SANYASIS. ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COMMIT TO THIS SANYAS LIFE CAN START GATHERING IN THE LOCALITIES OF OUR TEMPLES AND START PRACTISING. WE WILL CALL THEM AS AAPAT SANYASIS OR KRAMA BRAHMACHARIS. THEY WILL BE UNDER TRAINING AND CAN BE THERE AS LONG AS THEY WANT TO CONTINUE IN THAT PATH. THEY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE KAILASA ECOSYSTEM. THEY SHOULD INTRODUCE HINDUISM AND POWER MANIFESTATION SCIENCE CONTINUOUSLY TO THE PEOPLE. \n3) A LARGE LIBRARY WITH THE AMBIENCE IN BARNES AND NOBLE - LIKE HAVING COFFEE, HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS AND READING! HINDUISM IS STILL LIVING IN BOOKS, IT HAS NOT YET COME TO THE DIGITAL WORLD. WE STILL HAVE THE HABIT OF READING BOOKS AND LEARNING HINDUISM. SO WE WILL HAVE A LARGE LIBRARY, BUT WE WILL CONTINUE DOING DIGITISATION ALSO. \n4) IF POSSIBLE, A LARGE GOSHALA AND ANNALAYA. ALL OF THESE ARE INTERCONNECTED. COWS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ORGANICALLY, AND FOOD SHOULD BE GROWN AND SHARED FOR FREE. NEVER A TEMPLE’S FOOD CAN BE SOLD. \n5) AADHEENAM WHERE THE SANYASIS START LIVING TEACHING AND GROWING TOGETHER.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hMDoouhryaU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"hMDoouhryaU","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"shrikailasa-creation-of-enlightened-ecosystem-hmdoouhryau"}}
