The uniqueness of what he is sharing is that not all paths have the same speed or comfort.  Living with the best context and authenticity is the key that makes Nithyananda Sampradaya unique.\n\nMorning Satsang of Paramahamsa Nithyananda\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLast few days I am just soaked in Cambodia temples!  \n\nBefore entering into the satsangh, let me remind all of you today is Maha Parinirvana Day, the day my biological father achieved enlightenment and left the body.  I think as per the Hindu calendar, “Thithi”, “Punya Thithi”, we are observing this festival, this ritual.  “Punya Thithi” means, the day they left the body, that day is called “Punya Thithi”.  So as per the Vedic tradition exactly on that same “thithi” we are observing this Maheshwara Puja not only for my father, all the devotees, disciples, who lived Jeevan Mukthi, who were striving for Jeevan Mukthi, initiated disciples who lived Jeevan Mukthi, for all of them today we give “shraaddha”, we give “pinda tharpana”, and we are doing Maheshwara Puja.  The best place on Planet Earth to give “pinda tharpana” is the stomach of a sannyasi.  That is the “jataraagni”, the hunger fire of a sannyasi is the best fire on which you can offer the “pinda tharpana”, the “shraaddha”, which reaches the “pithrus”  directly.  It is thousand times more greater than offering any “pinda” , any “shraaddha”, in any river, any water-body, any tank, any lake, any holy land, any holy place.  Offering it in the stomach of a sannyasi is the best, best form of “pinda tharpana” and “shraaddha”.  \n\nI can challenge, in this whole world you will never find this many number of authentic Sannyasis anywhere!  I guarantee you with my name, this many Sannyasis authentically, authentically living!  I am telling you, I have lived in all monasteries: I have stayed in many Christian monasteries, I have stayed in many other religions’ monasteries, I have stayed even in Hindu monasteries. With all this authority I am telling you, this many number of Sannyasis, authentically living Advaitha, you will find only in Dhyanapeetam. We are the place where the largest number of Sannyasis are living the highest possible authentic Living Advaitha.  And the way they handle their each problem and solve it just only by Advaitic understanding!  Understand, I am a too powerful perfectionist, task-master, trainer. That’s the right word I have to use!  “Too, too, too perfectionist, powerful, task-master, trainer”!  Even the same result I want, I will not allow them to achieve using some other method or technique other than Living Advaitha.  Not just the “goal”, even the “path” I won’t compromise!  \n\nSee, for example, living a simple life.  If somebody is living a simple life because of their poverty consciousness, it is stupidity.  From a very young age they believe they are poor, and their life is going to be poor.  Out of that pattern, if somebody is living the poverty, I will not accept that as a “simple life”.  You will see automatically the situation will happen in such a way their desires will be aggravated, their greed will wake up.  Only if they come to the conclusion and decision of a “simple life” because of Advaithic understanding – || तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् || “thena thyakthena bhunjeethaa, maa gridhah kasyasvid dhanam” – “By renouncing everything, celebrating everything.”  This is the Advaithic context of renunciation.  By renouncing everything, celebrating everything.  I will let them rest in peace and live even  humbleness if they understand this right context,  not till then!  Everything they do, even if the goal is as we want, as desired, I will not keep quiet or tolerate and accept or adjust.  I will see to it even the understanding, path, the reason why their perfect, is also perfect.  Only then that perfection will be perfectly perfect and be eternal.  If that perfection is achieved by wrong reason, it’ll never be eternal.  If somebody achieves “simple life” out of poverty consciousness, I challenge the moment he gets easy money, all his “simple life” will disappear.  If somebody lives a “simple life” because of this grand understanding – \n|| तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ||\n\n\nLINK OF FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/masters-bouquet","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/OIHJPDMc4Gc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"OIHJPDMc4Gc","viewCount":1266,"eventDate":"2014-11-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-masters-bouquet-oihjpdmc4gc"}}
