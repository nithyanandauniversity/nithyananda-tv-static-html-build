Paramahamsa Nithyananda expands deeper on Pure Consciousness, giving the descriptions about ‘us’ by the Upanishadic Rishis, who are just exploding to speak about the unspeakable Consciousness, and so repeat again and again about Consciousness which is ISNESS, Self-Existent, All-Knowing Seer, Lord of Minds, everything. We as Consciousness are untouched by any incompletion or delusion, says the Upanishad, the ultimate authority – which cannot be negated or questioned by anyone. Never can any work, bring us tiredness or boredom. It is only the incompletions, the past thought patterns, that make us suffer. To experience these Truths and to heal ourselves, He urges us to do Spiritual Explorations or discussions –Vakyartha Sadas. \n\nIsha Upanishad – Verse 8\nsa paryagāc-chukram akāyam avraṇam  asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham |\nkavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr   yathātathyato-arthān vyadadhāc-chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ || 8 ||\n\nIn an enriching act to bring and radiate World Peace, Paramahamsa Nithyananda launches a global program called ’10,008 Minutes Of World Peace” starting 14 April 2015, starting with Peace for Kenya and later for other peace deprived places. \"\"Not only I am going to create Yogis, whose third eyes are awakened, I’m going to put them to use that energy in the direction of creating World peace\"\", He delcared. The Yogis of Nithyananda Sangha will continuously use their spiritual powers of will to bring the urgently needed World Peace and make it into a reality.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j6TTMCspYDU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"j6TTMCspYDU","viewCount":3086,"eventDate":"2015-04-13","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"you-are-untouched-by-incompletion-j6ttmcspydu"}}
