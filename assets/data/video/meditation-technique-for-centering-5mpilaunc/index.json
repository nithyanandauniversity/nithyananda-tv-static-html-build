The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 30, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) continues his instruction on self-remembrance. When we offer all our actions to prana -- to the ability to recall what we are --we gain immense benefit even from very small effort. At first we may find it difficult to maintain this conscious recollection and still engage in the activities of daily life, but with repetition we can strengthen our skills and ultimately we are successful. Keeping a journal of each activity -- driving to work, taking a meeting -- allows us to gauge our progress. During the twenty minute drive, did we remember the self for each of those twenty minutes? By tracking our focus throughout the day, we polish and perfect our practice.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday's satsang, 4th chapter in Bhagavad geeta -- Jnana Karma Sanyasa yoga 30th verse.\n\nApare Niyataa-haaraha praanaan-praaneshu juhvathi\n\nSarvep-yete yagna-bidaha yagnya-kshapita-kalmashaaha\n\nHaving restrained taking food, others who know the power of sacrifice offer their life breath into the vital air Praana and have the sins thrown out by this sacrifice.\n\nSee, yesterday I made it very clear. If you practice the Praana Samyama: the 3 things En-Chanting, Feeling connection, Unclutching. I will be able to easily lead you in to the hunger free samyama. Today Bhagwan is exactly describing the second samyama. \"Having restrained taking food others who know the power of sacrifice, offer their life breath in to the vital air and have the sins thrown out by this sacrifice.\" Please understand, some of the basic truths. The basic sacred secrets you need to know from this life, from this verse is -- constantly offering all your actions into your Praana. What it means? Means -- during all your activities, how much ever it may be demanding -- without losing your self, completely centered. Being centered in eN-Chanting, feeling connection and unclutching. That is what Krishna means \"offering all your actions in to Praana\". Please understand, here Praana means the ability of self-remembrance; ability of being spiritual centered, enlightenment centered, atma centric, Higher self centered. That is exactly what is meant by the word Praana. All you need to do let the whole day your routine, your life be centered on this self-remembrance -- these 3 actions: eN-Chanting, feeling connection and unclutching. Whole day. Unfortunately some of your actions demand your complete attention, emotion, complete involvement. Even during those actions start empowering the moments of remembrance. Please understand -- start empowering. Many of your actions may demand your whole attention. In the beginning it may not be that easily possible for you to be centered on unclutching and eN-chanting and feeling connection. But I tell you -- any activity, any action is possible being centered on Praana just by little practice. That is why Krishna says in another one Bhagawad Geeta verse \"even little bit of practice of this great science brings huge benefit. It's like a billions of rupees worth diamonds and gold is there in one room. You are doing only one small action -- opening the room. You'd have never imagined just that small action of opening the room will make you rich in one minute. You'd have never imagined such huge benefit will come by such a small action of opening the room. It was there in that room for ages, just now you got the key, you opened it, suddenly you saw -- Wow. It is all yours. Many time small actions you do does not bring big benefits. So you don't trust the small actions can bring big benefits. But rarely small actions do bring big benefits. This action -- the action of being Praana centered, even if it is small, practiced very little -- it brings huge benefits, great benefits. And I tell you, you will become so alive and productive. If you take 4 days of vacation and not being productive constantly, you are equivalent to dead. Now all we need to do is just put little more mud on your head and cover it. You already have clay in your brain -- you just need little more mud to cover your body. Just 4 days in your life continuously if you fall in to the laziness pattern, after that even you cannot help yourself. When you can't help yourself, neither God nor Guru can help you. Please understand whether Guru or God, even if they want to help you, they can't help you if you can't help yourself. See the Daksha story -- Daksha is God. Vishnu wants to help Daksha so much. It is so unfortunate he does not want to help himself. So even his God, Vishnu could not help him. Daksha had Saptarishis as his gurus.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5_mPIlaun_c/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDP0TozdO2RcLM7CUZvmL8bAfgtkQ","youtubeID":"5_mPIlaun_c","viewCount":5370,"eventDate":"2012-05-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"meditation-technique-for-centering-5mpilaunc"}}
