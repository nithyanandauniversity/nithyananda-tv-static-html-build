It was a massive and powerful ritual as it was conducted on a large scale personally by His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam consisting of 7 different Homas offered by 1008 families each for the healing and upliftment of human consciousness. 1008 homa kundas were set and the Saptayagam was attended by lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of people. \n\nSapta literally means “seven” and yagna is a “sacred fire ritual.” As old as time itself, homas or yagnas have been performed for 100,000 years for the benefit of mankind at large. The 7 homas or yagnas were an offering to the seven presiding deities of the seven chakras in the human system. The seven deities and their associated chakras are Ganapathy - Mooladhara Chakra, Subramanya - Swadhistana Chakra, Surya - Manipuraka Chakra, Venkateshwara - Anahata Chakra, Parashakti - Vishuddhi Chakra, Paramashiva - Ajna Chakra, and Guru - Sahasrara Chakra. The presiding deities along with many other deities were energized through this powerful ritual and sent to the spiritual embassies of KAILASA all over the world. Not only the Saptaygam benefited mankind in 2006, through the science of birthing deities, His Divine Holiness personally energized them and brought them to life to benefit and initiate anyone who has Darshan or “the divine sight” of these deities KAILASA’s temples worldwide\n\nFire is the purest form of the 5 elements that are earth, water, fire, air, and ether because it can never be contaminated. Any yajna when performed as described by the Vedas and Agamas,especially by a living incarnation harnesses the Cosmic energy through the mantras that are chanted and transfers the energy to the water that is stored in the pots for this purpose, which is in turn used to energize the place, people and the world. HDH personally guided each participant through the entire ritual explaining the scientific significance behind each offering. \n\nA ritual of this scale has been unheard of and is just one of the many services Bhagavan has provided to humanity. In this video, you can see Bhagavan Himself micromanaging the whole event end to end. From teaching the volunteers how to tie ‘nool’ or thread on the ‘kalashas’ or sacred vessel for holding the divine energy to organizing the layout of the 20 acre land used for the event, HDH oversaw every detail Himself. Bhagavan guided all the homa participants through the rigorous rituals while personally performing them Himself, and ended the marathon event by giving individual blessings to the lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of devotees who came. For over 2 decades, Bhagavan has been working sincerely and tirelessly like this to serve humanity and lay the groundwork for the KAILASA initiative. \n\nSuch large-scale offerings to humanity are the foundation for the KAILASA movement. KAILASA is a nation created by dispossessed Hindus from around the world who lost the right to practice Hinduism authentically in their own countries. Though the KAILASA movement is founded in the United States, and spearheaded by members of the Hindu Adi Shaivite minority community, it is created for, and offers a safe haven to all the world’s practicing, aspiring or persecuted Hindus, irrespective of race, gender, sect, caste, or creed, where they can peacefully live and express their spirituality, arts, and culture free from denigration, interference and violence.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1t791l3mIWk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"1t791l3mIWk","viewCount":3684,"eventDate":"2020-03-23","duration":1993,"likeCount":135,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"23"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"sacred-fire-ritual-to-invoke-and-worship-mother-energy-sapthayagam-salem-16-july-2006-1t791l3miwk"}}
