AS LIVING REPRESENTATIVE OF PARAMASHIVA AND PARASHAKTI, I BLESS YOU ALL. LET’S ALL HAVE THE STATE, SPACE, BEING, SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS OF PARAMASHIVA. LET PARAMASHIVA AND PARASHAKTI’S BLESSINGS BE SHOWERED ON ALL OF US. WE HAVE STARTED THE 42ND AVATARA DINA BRAMOTSAVA TODAY! \n\n*TODAY’S MESSAGE FROM KAILASHA: WITH THE GRACE OF PARAMASHIVA, PARASHAKTI, GANAPATI, NANDI, SUBRAMANYA, MAHAKALABHAIRAVA, ALL GODS AND GODDESSES OF KAILASHA, THE PURPOSE OF MY INCARNATION IS TO MANIFEST SRIKAILASHA. \n\n*WHAT DO I MEAN BY MANIFESTING KAILAASA? IT MEANS IN  MULTIPLE LEVELS, MANIFESTING MAHAKAILASHA IN BHU LOKA AS SRIKAILASHA. EACH ONE OF US HAS TO MANIFEST THE STATE OF PARAMASHIVA. STATE OF PARAMASHIVA MEANS ABSOLUTELY UNCLUTCHED. GRAVITY IS NEVER FELT BY YOU IS STATE OF PARAMASHIVA. \n\n*THE FOOD DIGESTED IN YOUR STOMACH, THE EMOTION DIGESTED IN YOUR HEART, THE THOUGHT CURRENT DIGESTED IN YOUR HEAD SHOULD BE SO LIGHT. GRAVITY IS EXPERIENCED BY YOU AS HEAVINESS IN THE STOMACH, HEART AND HEAD. \n\n*IF ALL THESE THREE ARE LIGHT AND DOES NOT MAKE YOU FEEL THE HEAVINESS. YOU ARE UNCLUTCHED! IF FOOD IN STOMACH IS NOT MAKING YOU FEEL GRAVITY, YOU ARE NITHYA NIRAHARI. VYASA AFTER EATING FROM GOPIKA, HE SAYS, “IF I AM IN UPAVASA, ON NIRAHARA, LET YAMUNA PART AND GIVE WAY FOR ME.” AND YAMUNA PARTED! \n\n*IF THE QUANTITY, QUALITY AND WAY YOU TAKE YOUR FOOD DOES NOT MAKE YOU HEAVY, YOU ARE NITHYA NIRAHARA - THEN YOU ARE UNCLUTCHED®!\n\n*THE EMOTIONS YOU CHERISH IN YOUR HEART, IF DOES NOT SEND CHILLS IN YOUR SPINE AND MAKES YOUR HEART HEAVY - THEN YOU ARE UNCLUTCHED®! \n\n*THE THOUGHT CURRENTS CHERISHED IN YOUR HEAD IF DOES NOT MAKE YOU FEEL SAD, FRUSTRATED AND DEPRESSED - THEN YOU ARE UNCLUTCHED! \n\n*UNCLUTCHING INTENSELY AND SINCERELY, NOTHING CAN BE COMPARED TO THE ABILITY OF UNCLUTCHING AS A WEALTH TO BE EARNED IN THIS LIFE WHILE YOU ALIVE. WHILE YOU ARE IN THE BODY, THE HIGHEST GREATEST AND BEST WEALTH YOU NEED TO HAVE IS ABILITY TO UNCLUTCH®. \n\n*IT IS MY ABILITY TO BE UNCLUTCHED® THAT I AM STILL ALIVE! OTHERWISE, LONG BEFORE, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE. IF I HAD MIND, I WOULD HAVE HAD MENTAL BREAKDOWN LONG BEFORE. BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE ONE , I AM NOT HAVING MENTAL BREAKDOWN. ABILITY TO UNCLUTCH® MAKES YOU A DIFFERENT METAL ALTOGETHER.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6y1sG3wt-Lc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"6y1sG3wt-Lc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"unclutchr-and-rip-rest-in-paramashiva-6y1sg3wt-lc"}}
