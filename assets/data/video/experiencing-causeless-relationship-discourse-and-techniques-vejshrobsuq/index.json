In this clip, Swamiji talks about a beautiful incident from the life of Ramanuja that deeply demonstrates his love for whole humanity.  When you are deeply in love with everyone, you feel responsible for them.  Those who have used love to the subject became enlightened.  To be in love you must be capable of turning the experience of love towards ones self and not the object of love.  Swamiji says that as long as our love is towards the object, we are materialistic.  We tend to equate the being to matter.  We are reducing the spirit to matter.  In this clip Swamiji then goes on to describe two beautiful techniques to experience the causeless relationship.
