Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi are not only deeper than yama, niyama, asana, pranayama and pratyahara but Dhyana is deeper than Dharana and Samadhi is deeper than Dhyana.\"\n\nIn Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi, not just your time, your awareness is required. An ordinary working mentality is enough to achieve the previous 5. You don't need awareness or consciousness. Your conscious part is not required to be participating. Just stretch your body, do the breathing etc. but for Prathyahara to become Dharana, a new entity in You needs to be awakened. An individual need to be awakened should be present - Prathayahara chaitanya.\n\nBeing honest to the position you are holding is Sathya, especially the Guru disciple relationship. This honesty is required to move from Pratyahara to Dharana. Feeling responsible for the space you are in makes the quantitative shift in you, for you to move from Pratyahara to Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. If you take up responsibility and allow the creativity to happen in that responsibility, then you will sail from Dharana to Dhyana to Samadhi. \n\nLife is for the people who are conscious, life is for the people who are interested in creating, for those who are honest and sincere to the place they hold; the responsibility which they are in. If you are responsible you won't have negativity to be in depression. \n\nDishonesty leads you to more and more depression. When you take up the responsibility, a tremendous courage and security will happen around you. Till you take the responsibility, you will suffer with insecurity. It is an automatic mechanism given by God. \n\nWhen you feel connected to the object on which you are concentrating, the stuff out of which the object is made, that is Dharana. The mind flows in an unbroken way from the mind to the object. When both lose their boundary and come closer, it's called Dhyana. When the stuff out of which both are made lose their identity into something from which both came, its Samadhi.\n\nAs long as your life is in the hands of the divine, you don't need to be afraid.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mufSY07NjFA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLASeccCq5IsdAFnC82gYeHh09r6Iw","youtubeID":"mufSY07NjFA","viewCount":8591,"eventDate":"2011-02-08","duration":2541,"likeCount":71,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"17"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"dharana-dhyana-samadhi-ultimate-keys-to-absolute-patanjali-yoga-sutra-113-by-nithyananda-7-feb-2011-mufsy07njfa"}}
