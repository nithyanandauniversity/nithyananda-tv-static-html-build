These past records are called Aakashic records. According to modern science, 90% of the so called junk DNA contain the history of all our past births.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda elaborates on this and shows that Vedic literature like Upanishads, shastras etc. are filled with content which speak about this scientific truth thousands of years ago.\n\nHe talks about agamya karma and sanchita karma. Agamya karma comprises the desires which we build in this life time. Sanchita karma comprises all the unfulfilled desires of all our lives and these are stored in DNA as supported by the recent scientific studies.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda says that in Vedic tradition, language was not just a mode of communication for people. It was used to retrieve the information from DNA. Language was taught as science of sound and how prana can be used to retrieve these aakashic records stored in our DNA.\n\nHe describes avatar (incarnation) is a person who has the ability to retrieve all records from the DNA. He also describes the concept of poison in Shiva's neck.\n\nHe talks about karma yoga and past life regression also in this context.
