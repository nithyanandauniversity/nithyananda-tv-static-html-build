The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 14, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) emphasizes the importance of celibacy as a lifestyle for all spiritual seekers. He gives specific physical reasons why sexual activity prevents the accurate awakening of kundalini energy and why it impedes the journey to enlightenment. To reprogram our biomemories we must transform all primitive actions which bind to our former animal lives.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday, Nirahara samyama successfully happening 9th day. Today we are starting Nirahara Samyama level 1 4th batch.\n\nprashaan-taatmaa vigata-bheehi brahma-chaarivrate sthitaha |\n\nmanaha samyamya macchittaha yukta aaseetha matparaha ||\n\nBeing serene with oneself, abstaining from apprehensions, having subdued the thoughts, intent on the vow of living like a God, following the vow of celibacy, intensely reflecting on Me, live your life devoted to Me.\n\nIn this verse, Bhagawan breaks one of the important sacred secret/truth to the humanity. He uses the word 'brahmacharya'- living like a God. Just because I have the Rishi sampradaya also, does not mean I accept this concept of marriage in the life of a seeker. I am making it very clear. I am putting it very clear. Worst thing can happen to a seeker, in the spiritual life is marriage, I know, I am going to break thousands of peoples' ignorance. Understand as a compassionate being I have to give a place for everybody. Tolerated is different, accepted is different, realized is different. Marriage in the seekers' life is tolerated. Rishi order is accepted. But only brahmacharya is promoted. Whenever you go to the peak based on body you get back to your animal bio-memory and again it takes atleast a few years of spiritual practice for you to raise to the level of divine. It is very rare I speak about the importance of  brahmacharya because sometime it puts the householders into depression. But just because they fall into depression I cannot be hiding the sacred truths for quite a long time. No. It is time  I have decided I am going to speak about it completely.\n\nLet me define brahmacharya as per the smruti.\n\nKarmanaa manachaa vaachaa sarvaavastu sarvadaa\n\nSarvatra maidyatvyahu brahmacharyam prachakshyadet\n\nBrahmacharya is defined as abstinence from sexual intercourse in thought, word and deed in all conditions and places and times.\n\nBrahmacharyena tapasa devaa mrutyum ubagnataha\n\nThis is the Atharva veda's definition. The Gods are said to have conquered death by brahmacharya. Tantra speaks about brahmacharya, understand. I will give you some more references.\n\nJnana Sankalini Tantra :\n\nnathapas tapayithi ahuhu brahmacharyam tapottamam\n\noordvaretwa bhavet yastu sadhevonatu maanushaahaa\n\nThe true tapas is brahmacharya and he who practices it uninterruptedly is divine not human. Now let me come to the practical side of it. Understand, already one-third of your life is gone in search of food, one-third has gone in sleep, in the remaining one-third, till 25 too busy with education, after 65, body and mind won't be useful to do anything, then between 25 and 65, that 40 years, if you get married also, gone. Seeking is building the new consciousness for you to take a jump. It is like building an airport. How an airport runway is necessary for an aircraft to take off, brahmacharya body is necessary for you to take off into enlightenment, into the planes of consciousness, into the space of consciousness.\n\nOne of the main reasons, Hinduism stopped being the tradition of living stream, as a head of the oldest Hindu monastery, as a representative of the Hindu tradition, I am making this statement as self-introspection and self-criticism. It is very, very, very unfortunate that Hindu tradition is not remaining as a living stream of enlightened beings. I can say, there are enlightened beings. There are few incarnations but unfortunately Hinduism lost the streams of living Masters, the streams which guarantees the production of living Master. The organization or sangas, which guarantees atleast a few hundred living Masters are continuously available from that source to the planet earth. I can guarantee you, in Tibetian Buddhist tradition, at any given point, one thousand living Masters are there, enlightened masters. I can guarantee you, Japanese Zen tradition, at any given time, hundred living Masters are there, minimum. I cannot guarantee you, in Hinduism there is any organization which can guarantee minimum hundred living masters at any given time.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ckKOc62Jibs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLC6Ksum8zqNuB2QYeIu0HNKyWUl7g","youtubeID":"ckKOc62Jibs","viewCount":73503,"eventDate":"2012-09-17","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"24"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"celibacy-the-only-way-for-seekers-ckkoc62jibs"}}
