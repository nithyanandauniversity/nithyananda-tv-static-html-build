WE WILL SEE EVERYTHING AUSPICIOUS IN ALL OUR LIVES AND FOR KAILASA, GANAPATHI IS A SARVA MANGALA SWAROOPA, ALWAYS AUSPICIOUS.\n\n*YOU CAN WORSHIP HIM FOR ANYTHING. THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANY PREPARATION. YOU MAY BE A SHAIVITE, KAUMARA, ANYTHING. EVEN VAISHNAVITES WORSHIP GANAPATHI, BEFORE THEY START THE PUJA. IN TAMILNADU THEY HAVE A UNIQUE NAME FOR HIM - THUMBIKKAI AAZHVAR.\nGANAPATI IS WORSHIPED BY ALL SAMPRADAYAS OF HINDUISM. THERE IS NO SAMPRADAYA THAT DENIES THE PLACE OF GANAPATI AS THE FIRST LORD.\n\n*THERE ARE SOME COMMON THINGS ACCEPTED BY ALL HINDU SAMPRADAYAS LIKE THE THE AUTHORITY OF THE VEDAS, THE ABSOLUTE SACREDNESS OF THE ‘OM’, THE SACREDNESS OF GOMATA. SAME WAY WITH GANAPATHI.\n\n*YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN VERSION OF GANAPATI. EACH ONE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN NAMES GIVEN TO GANAPATI BUT HE IS THE FIRST; PRATHAMAM. HE IS THE MOST AUSPICIOUS SWEET GOD. HE EATS SWEETS, GIVES SWEETS AND HE HIMSELF IS SWEET!\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S DIRECT MESSAGE FROM KAILASA:\n\n*UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR EXISTENCE CAN CO-EXIST WITHOUT CHAOS AND PRIORITISING SIMULTANEOUSLY SPONTANEOUSLY IN YOU MAKES YOU CHAOS FREE, STRESS FREE, TIREDNESS FREE, INCOMPLETION FREE, WORRY FREE.\n\n*VERY SIMPLE: VISUALISE YOURSELF WITH 25 HEADS, 75 EYES OF PARAMASHIVA. DECIDE ALL YOUR PROBLEM, DIFFICULTIES, YOU WILL THINK THROUGH THIS 25 HEADS AND FIND SOLUTIONS.\n\n*THESE VISUALISATIONS LIKE 25 HEADS, 50 HANDS, 75 EYES OF PARAMASHIVA WILL EXPAND YOUR CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY. MARK THIS WORD.\n\n*CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY IS THE CAPACITY TO CONCEIVE LARGER IDEAS, IDEOLOGIES, PRINCIPLES, THEOLOGIES, WITHOUT GETTING BROKEN OR DAMAGED AND FEELING CONSTANTLY ALL THE MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR EXISTENCE AND THE COSMOS IS ORGANISED, CENTERED YOU - YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\n*IF YOU FEEL, IN THE WAKING STATE WHO YOU ARE AND IN THE DREAM STATE WHO YOU ARE IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONNECTED AND NOT EVEN ABLE TO CONNECT, BE VERY CLEAR IT MEANS YOU ARE HIGHLY STRESSED AND ALMOST BROKEN INSIDE.\n\n*THE MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU - DREAMING PART, VISUALISATION PART, THINKING PART, EMOTIONAL COMPONENT, FEELING COMPONENT, DECIDING COMPONENT, ALL THIS, IF IT IS CONNECTED, IN SYNCH SYNERGY, THAT IS WHAT I CALL CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY. IT GETS PULLED, PUSHED, DRAGGED, BUT NEVER BREAKS. FALLING INTO DREAM STATE, DEEP SLEEP, GETTING OUT OF IT, WILL ALL BE ALMOST LIKE A SWEET VACATION.\n\n*ARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA TAUGHT ME THE KNOWLEDGE OF JYOTISHA. IN HINDU TRADITION, JYOTISH MEANS USING CONSCIOUS ENERGY AND ALIGNING YOURSELF WITH THE PLANETS AND GRAHAS, SEEING THE FUTURE FLOW OF INDIVIDUALS LIFE AND THE COSMIC HAPPENINGS. THIS IS CONSCIOUSNESS BASED EDUCATION.\n\n*THERE IS A NEXT MATHEMATICAL BASED EDUCATION CALLED SURYA SIDDHANTA - USING THIS CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE. PREDICTING NEXT SOLAR ECLIPSE, LUNAR ECLIPSE, AMAVASYA. IT IS MORE LIKE BUILDING THE ALMANAC- PANCHANGA. IT IS A MORE CLERICAL JOB.\n\n*MY GURU RAGHUPATI YOGI TRIED TO TEACH ME SURYA SIDDHANTA AFTER ARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA INITIATED ME INTO JYOTISHA. MY GURU USED TO WRITE IN CHARCOAL AND CHALK PIECE. HE WILL DRAW THE DIFFERENT PLANETARY AND STAR POSITIONS. FROM THE HOUSE HE WILL GET KOLA MAAVU - COLOURED POWDER USED TO MAKE RANGOLI. ONE DAY, HE WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HOW THE MULTIPLICATION OF NUMBERS AS PER THE INFINITE LOGIC.\n\n*THE BINARY LOGIC’S MULTIPLICATION ALL OF US KNOW: 2+2 = 4. 2*2=4. 3+3=6. 3*3=9. ALL THIS BELONGS TO BINARY LOGIC.\n\n*BUT SQUARE, TO THE POWER OF 3 - ALL OF THESE BELONG TO INFINITE LOGIC.\n\n*ALL THIS DEEP MATHEMATICS IS THE GIFT OF HINDU TRADITION. THE WESTERN MATHEMATICIANS NEITHER DISCOVERED NOR IMAGINED 90% OF HINDU MATHEMATICS. BY REVEALING THAT 90% OF HINDU BRAIN IS RELIVING THE SOURCE OF MATHEMATICS. NUMBERS ARE LIVING GODS FOR HINDUS.\n\n*I HAVE SEEN MY GURUS. THEY WILL DRAW THE NUMBER, WORSHIP IT AND MANIFEST POWERS. JUST LIKE VARUNA, VAYU, INDRA ARE GODS, NUMBERS ARE GODS.\n\n*WHEN YOU WORSHIP COW AS CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE, THE AMOUNT OF GOOD THINGS YOU RECEIVE IN YOUR LIFE, ONLY A COW WORSHIPPER KNOWS!\n\n*IF YOU WORSHIP THE BHOOMA DEVI AS GODDESS, THE AMOUNT OF THINGS YOU GET, ONLY A WORSHIPPER KNOWS.\n\n*WHY I INSIST ON PHYSICALLY DETOXIFYING YOU IS BECAUSE IF YOU PHYSICALLY DETOX YOURSELF, YOU CAN GRASP WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY NUMBERS ARE GODS.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4218405208247297","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gkv67shyARk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"gkv67shyARk","viewCount":8444,"eventDate":"2020-08-12","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"conscious-elasticity-capacity-to-conceive-larger-ideas-and-principles-without-breaking-gkv67shyark"}}
