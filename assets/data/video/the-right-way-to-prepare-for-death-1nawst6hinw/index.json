I am relaxing into it.\" Nithya Satsang (26th January 2016) on Isavasya Upanishads, mantra 17, in Living Advaita Series, makes Paramahamsa Nithyananda verbalize the realizations of the Rishis (perfected sages) who uttered this mantra. Our breathing pattern is our Life, it can never lie, for it reveals to the Siddhas, the Raw Enliightened Beings, the secrets of our mind and beyond. In other words, our guilts, fear, incompletions alter our breathing patterns. Using the breathing patterns and achieving extraordinary powers and enlightenment was one of the important sciences of Hindu tradition. Through this mantra, Paramahamsa Nithyananda gives the profound practice of 21 nights-days to consciously make our breathing pattern (vayu), our individual life-energy to merge and dissolve into the Cosmic Breathing Pattern (Anilam) to experience the Nectar of Cosmic Life-Breath (amrtam).
