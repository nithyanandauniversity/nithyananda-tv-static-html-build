HE WAS EXTREMELY LOVING AND CARING. THE AMOUNT OF LOVE, CARE, ENERGY, BEST THINGS HE SHOWERED AND IS SHOWERING ON ME…! HE WAS ALSO EXTREMELY STERN, MEANS FEROCIOUS, TO CORRECT ME.\n*I STILL REMEMBER ONE INCIDENT: I CARRIED FOOD FOR HIM FROM HOME IN A SMALL BRASS VESSEL. FORTUNATELY, MY MOTHER SAVED IT AND STILL WE HAVE THAT VESSEL DIRECTLY TOUCHED BY ARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA.\n*HE ATE FROM THAT VESSEL AND GAVE ME FEW MORSELS OF FOOD AND I ALSO ATE. \n*WHILE EATING, FEW GRAINS FELL ON THE GROUND. AFTER A FEW MINUTES, HE WASHED HIS HANDS AND I WASHED MY HANDS. \n*THERE WERE SOME ANTS TRYING TO TAKE THAT FEW RICE GRAINS ON THE FLOOR.\n*I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE ANTS NEAR HIM. SO TO PROTECT HIM, I WAS ABOUT TO KILL THEM.\n*HE IMMEDIATELY, FEROCIOUSLY STOPPED ME AND SAID, ‘DO YOU SEE THE ANTS ARE NOT EVEN COMING NEAR MY BODY? THEY ARE JUST PICKING THEIR FOOD AND GOING?’\n*I SAID YES. HE SAID, ‘THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL THEM? IF THEY ARE COMING TOWARDS ME IT CAN BE JUSTIFIED SAYING PROTECTING GURU IS THE HIGHEST DHARMA; ALL OTHER DHARMA IS NEXT. BUT YOU ARE SEEING VERY CLEARLY THEY ARE GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, NOT EVEN COMING ANYWHERE NEAR ME. JUST YOUR CASUAL DECISION TO KILL THEM, YOU ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY INSIDE YOU AS A PROTECTION OF GURU.’\n*I SAW VERY CLEARLY I GOT IRRITATED SEEING ANTS THERE BUT WHEN HE QUESTIONED ME, SUDDENLY SPONTANEOUSLY I TOLD IT IS TO PROTECT THE GURU\n*HAVING ONE INTENTION AND UTTERING ANOTHER, IS CUNNINGNESS\n*CUNNINGNESS IS A MENTAL DISORDER. \n*IT WAS A SHOCK FOR ME!\n*HE SAID, ‘YOUR INTENTION TO KILL THOSE ANTS WAS CASUAL. YOU THOUGHT: ‘EH, THEY ARE POWERLESS CREATURES. WHAT CAN THEY DO? ‘AND YOU DID NOT EVEN COMPLETELY LOOK IN GET INVOLVED. AND WHEN THE GURU ASKED, YOU SUDDENLY CHANGED IT. EVEN YOU STARTED BELIEVING INSIDE AND SO SPONTANEOUSLY YOU CREATED THE FALSE INTENTION, THE LIE!’\n*HE WAS SO FEROCIOUS.\n*OF COURSE I UNDERSTOOD AND IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED TO HIM, ‘YES BHAGAVAN, YES SWAMIJI.’\n*HE TOLD ME, ‘DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY JANMAS THAT ANT HAS TO TAKE TO GROW FROM THAT SINGLE CELL TO THE ANT BODY? ALL THESE YEARS THAT ANT WORKED FOR CONSCIOUS SOVEREIGNTY... (HE USED THE WORD ‘ATMA SIDDHI). AND BY THIS FOOD TOUCHED BY ME, IF THE ANT EATS, IT IS GOING TO JUST RAISE ITS CONSCIOUSNESS MUCH MORE AND HAVE THE NEXT BIRTH ITSELF AS HUMAN BODY! HOW CAN YOU INTERFERE IN THAT FLOW OF ELEVATION AND JUST KILL AN ANT?’\n*THIS INCIDENT WOKE ME UP TO THE REALITY OF DHARMA AND KARMA\n*WE SHOULD MAKE ALL DECISIONS BASED ON DHARMA, NOT ON SOCIAL COMFORT, MATERIAL WORLD COMFORT AND CUNNING STRATEGIES.\n*I COULD SEE VERY CLEARLY, HOW WE MAKE CUNNING STRATEGIES BASED DECISIONS IN EVERY SITUATION AND NEVER BASED ON DHARMA - WHAT IS RIGHT.\n*MANY TIMES WE DON'T EVEN WANT TO SPEND TIME TO KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT. WE JUST CHOOSE THE EASY WAY OUT!\n*WE THINK, ‘WHAT IS THE BEST WAY WE CAN GET OUT OF A SITUATION’\n*I WAS SHOCKED HOW JUST FOR OUR EASY WAY OUT, WE ARE READY TO KILL LIFE!\n*ACTUALLY THAT INCIDENT HAS TAUGHT ME SO MANY THINGS.\n\nREAD MORE AT : https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/360059865486851\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OM-qeiYIPtAkBe9veG5uw/join\n\n\n\nGet Your Free E-Passport at join.kailaasa.org and receive all the gifts to live enlightenment! \nhttps://kailaasa.org/e-passport/","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NVjv-xhH4ac/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"NVjv-xhH4ac","viewCount":1196,"eventDate":"2021-07-18","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"integrity-is-the-most-beautiful-powerful-successful-strategy-to-manifest-conscious-sovereignity-nvjv-xhh4ac"}}
