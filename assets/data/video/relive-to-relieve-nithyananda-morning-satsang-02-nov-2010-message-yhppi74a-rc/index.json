He began by quoting research by modern day Rishis.\n\nScientists in the field of past life regression like Dr.Brian.L.Weiss (leading psychotherapist and author of 'same-soul many bodies, many lives many masters) and Dr.Ian Stevenson state: \n\nPast life therapy can be a cure for psychological ailments like unexplained fears for example -- claustrophobia, which is a fear of closed spaces. \nA person relived a past life in which he was buried alive in an earthquake. Once the trauma was released, he was able to overcome the fear (healing evidence of a claustrophobic patient)\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda confirmed he knew this to be true. If you are buried alive or got drowned in past life you have claustrophobia. Not only that if you have strong fears about your parents especially your father, you will project the same thing onto your guru. If you have loving relationship with your father, you will have no trouble loving Paramahamsa Nithyananda.\n\n'Samsaya' or doubt is such a demon, it makes you uncomfortable everywhere. Wherever you go if you start doubting your whole life becomes hell and impossible to live. There are many things you are carrying from the past lives. An inability to open up, to trust is a worst hell. Because with that quality, however comfortable life is, you just can't live. You will suffocate. Claustrophobia and living with people whom you can't trust is one and the same. Even if you have huge house and wealth, if you don't trust the people you live with, you will have deep claustrophobia. Even with so much space, you will feel suffocation.\n\nIf you look at all the engrams in you -- accepting that they are there and looking through -- go on digging, digging -- you will see the 1st layer past & 2nd layer past will open up. This is a most powerful process for the past life regression.\n\nAn abstract from www.healpastlives.com says morbid obesity or clinically severe obesity is a life threatening condition caused by a chronic urge to over eat. Research says that although genetic mutation, physical addiction, brain chemistry and psychological pain may be the causes, unhealed past life karma is the primary cause. Further, research says the most common past life causes for morbid obesity are:\n1. Starvation in one or more past lives leads to constant desire to overeat.  2. Fear of past and guilt from past lives.\nIn addition, Paramahamsa Nithyananda add that if you have cheated somebody's food, again that karma lands in your system. All countries which are depriving food from other countries through various methods -- scientifically, socially, economically -- they are suffering with obesity.\n\nAs a great understanding of life, food should be free for humanity. Paramahamsa Nithyananda advised all his devotees and disciples to keep their kitchen open to any visitor, beggar, sadhu, guest or even the animals who live in that area. All of them should be given food. He told all of his viewers to work towards making food free on planet earth, and everyone will see wealth and prosperity constantly showered on them. Furthermore, sharing will relieve you from obesity.  \n\nSame way if you learn moment by moment, all that happens will become lessons and energy in you and they leave you. But you dump all the incidents as engrams in you. That stored engram which has not become intelligence in you is stored as past engrams.\n\nNow, re-living them with intelligence, the unnecessary part leaves you. By digesting them and making them as wisdom and releasing unnecessary engrams from your system is 'healing the past'. By Reliving the past, you will relieve yourself of its effect on your present.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhPPi74a-rc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAxzSulzTeNyvhsOLAUIHOVFzIrMw","youtubeID":"YhPPi74a-rc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"10"},{"id":"35"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"relive-to-relieve-nithyananda-morning-satsang-02-nov-2010-message-yhppi74a-rc"}}
