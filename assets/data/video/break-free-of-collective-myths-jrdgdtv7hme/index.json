The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 8, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) describes the essence of being sadhu. The classical definition of sadhu is one who has renounced all attachments and lives in a state of holy wandering. Nithyananda tells us that we can broaden this understanding for the new millennium. To save humanity, we must all relinquish our support of money-based and power-based systems, which have created greed, corruption and violence. Once we change our values to base our lives on personal self-worth and spiritual freedom, we can live like sadhus even in the material world. Our transformation will create the 21st century consciousness on Planet Earth.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\n6th chapter Dhyana yoga 8th verse\n \nJnana Vijnaana Truptaatmaa\nKootastho vijitendriyaha\nYukta ityuchyate yogi\nsama-losh-taashma-kaanchanaha\n \n'The one who is fulfilled with the awakening of consciousness and intelligence, who remains firmly established by overcoming the patterns, who is intense and who views with impartiality whether it is a lump of mud, a stone or gold, is said to be united. means achieved the ultimate'.\n \nNow Bhagawan is straight landing on the root patterns of the mind. Understand, let me repeat the sacred secrets in this verse..'One who is fulfilled with the awakening of conscious and intelligence, who remains firmly established by overcoming all the patterns, who is intense and who views with impartiality whether it is lump of mud, a stone or gold'. Bhagawan is hitting at the root of ignorance. Please understand, What is really taking us away from being centered on contentment? What is it that takes your contentment away? The idea of MONEY! You feel somebody has more than you. So only when you have more and more, you will be able to do what you want. Only that leads to contentment. That is the idea of money. What is idea of money? Who makes gold valuable? Who makes dollar currency valuable? Again, it is the law established. Please understand, it is not always greed, you can say, may be Gold, people have started becoming greedy because of that color and shining and all that. What about currency? Why people become greedy? Because of the law established. The fear created. The commonly accepted - Please understand, commonly accepted mutual ideas, Mutual understandings.\n \nIn the beginning, when everybody wants gold, the king would have made a rule - This will be valued, because less available, more needed, then the loss evolved, the value, weight, sharing, giving, taking, holding. Then when the stealing has started, laws to punish the people who steel, everything has started evolving.\n \nEven now, what keeps the dollar's value? If you are not ready to do your trades on dollar, there is every possibility you will be attacked later on. Please understand, How the value of the currencies are added or reduced? How much is needed in the world? I have to talk, revealing the deeper secrets of the human mind, How the human mind functions, Who makes you believe you having the gold or having money currency in your bank balance is a security for you? The laws created. Why those laws stand alive? The Fear created. How the whole fear and the law is sustained? Again, based on the demand and supply. Why should law make Gold as an important thing? Because less supply more demand. Why the stones don't have value but the diamonds have value? Because less supply more demand. And I tell you, the diamond industries -- they try to keep the supply less, to keep the value high. If they open their whole market, what ever is available to the market, it will be less than stone. The value will be less than stone! What is the difference between a stone and diamond? Only one difference - Less supply more demand. Otherwise, there are more shining stones than diamond. It is not just shining makes it valuable. It is the collective unconscious decisions which were made and continuously being maintained.\nIf you just remove few people, who are maintaining these collective unconscious understandings from the top, the whole thing will collapse, tumble down! In the world, there is a constant fight. How I say - The people who maintain the collective unconscious understandings, as the social system, If those few pins are removed, the whole system will collapse. Same way, the communists say the few spiritual leaders who maintain, the collective myth of enlightenment, if they are removed, the whole system will tumble down. I look at their system as a myth.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRDgdtV7HME/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCOcMxjNqU3UqA3gvIT8uoLmhbPig","youtubeID":"JRDgdtV7HME","viewCount":1355,"eventDate":"2012-09-09","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"break-free-of-collective-myths-jrdgdtv7hme"}}
