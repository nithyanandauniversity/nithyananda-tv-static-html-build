When we understand the root patterns of our life we can get out of those patterns. When we help others to get out of their patterns we can enrich them. Swamiji elaborated on 28th and 29th verse of Kathopnishad. When Nachiketa stands by his request, Yama falls in love with Nachiketa's Authenticity and tells him the first secret. He tells Nachiketa the importance of choosing between the \"good\" and the \"pleasant\". That which is good may not be always pleasant and that which is pleasant may not be always good for us. Swamiji inspired everyone to choose authenticity even if it appears unpleasant, because he who chooses the pleasant over the good misses the true end.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nPrathap come on!
