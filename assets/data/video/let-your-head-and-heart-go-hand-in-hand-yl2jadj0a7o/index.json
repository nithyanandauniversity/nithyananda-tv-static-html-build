In this profound delivery of the Isha Upanishad, Verse I, Paramahamsa Nithyananda expresses the differences between conclusiveness and inclusiveness, logic and emotion, and the head and heart. Once these two merge, the ultimate reality is perceived and lived as reality. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nThe first sutra!  Please listen!  Let us repeat:\n\nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥ 1 ॥\n\nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n\nIn the original writing, the sutra is “Jagathyaam Jagath” (जगत्यां जगत्).  But, if you see, when I pronounce, I will be pronouncing as “Jagathu”.  This is the way I heard from my masters.  It is called “Paatta Bhedha”.  See, the accent, each master has his own accent.  Originally I heard the Upanishads from Isakki Swami, Yogananda Puri, and Vibhootananda Puri – these three.  So, when I heard from them, the accent with which I heard is usually revered and respected as “Paatta Bhedha”.  And, moreover, when I retain the accent, I also remember them, and it is the way of honouring the Guru, retaining the “Paatta Bhedha” of the Guru – means, the accent of the Guru – without questioning or trying to correct.  It is a kind of respect and reverence shown to the masters in Vedic Tradition.  It is called “Paatta Bhedha”.  Means, your teacher in your area, the way he teaches, the way he chants, the way the accent is maintained, just retaining it.  When I heard the same Upanishads in Ramakrishna Mission in Bengal, the pronounciation and accent is a little different:  “EeshOvOshyOmidhOm ShOrvOm YOthkinchO JOgOthyOm JOgOth”.  Because, in Bengal, all the “ah” will become “oh”.  In Bengali, it is never “VivekanAndA”; it is “BiBekanOndO”.  So, retaining that accent is the respect given to that Guru, and it is called “Paatta Bhedha” in our tradition.  The way I heard exactly from my masters, I am repeating, retaining the “Paatta Bhedha”.  The way I chant – “JagathU”, “dhanammm” – all these additions are not actually available in the form of letter in the original verses.  But, I just wanted to retain the purity of the “Paatta Bhedha”.  I don’t feel “Paatta Bhedha” is in any way disturbing the originality of the verses.  So I am retaining it as it is.\nLet us enter into the verse now.\n\nॐ ईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nOm Eeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\n\nListen!\n\n“By the Consciousness enveloped must this all be,\nwhatever moving there is in the moving world.”\n\nListen!  Yesterday I was explaining two concepts.  Later on I tried to ask my sannyasis, ‘How many of you understood?’  Anyhow.....now I am explaining it again.  It means, you understand how many understood!  HAHAHAHAHA! \n\nTwo words I introduced: “Inclusiveness” and “Conclusiveness”. \n\nListen!  Whenever you operate based on logic, you arrive to conclusions, and move from conclusions to more conclusions.  Like Maths: Conclusions!  And Science: Conclusions!  Your logic, thinking!  One of the important components of your life moves in the line of conclusions.  It doesn’t care about anything else.  It doesn’t care about anything else.  One of the biggest problems you face in this way of moving with conclusions.....  There are many advantages when you are moving with conclusions.  If you want to reach Delhi, if you have a conclusive calculation – how many hours it will take, which road you will have to drive, how many kilometres from where you are.....  You need conclusive details; only then you can reach Delhi.  So, there are many advantages if you move in the language of logic; it is very conclusive.  Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages.  Even you will feel bored because life itself is not always conclusive, and life itself is not always logically analyzable and quantifiable or reproducible.\n\nLink For Full Transcript :- http://nithyananda.org/video/let-your-head-and-heart-go-hand-hand#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/yl2jaDJ0a7o/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"yl2jaDJ0a7o","viewCount":5719,"eventDate":"2015-01-30","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"let-your-head-and-heart-go-hand-in-hand-yl2jadj0a7o"}}
