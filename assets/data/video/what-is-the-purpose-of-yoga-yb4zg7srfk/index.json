Yoga is much more than just the physical postures, the asanas, and its goal is much more than just our health and well-being. Through yoga, our body, mind, and our breathing reach their peak potential, ultimately to awaken our Kundalini Shakti. Once that is awakened, extraordinary abilities and powers open up in us. This makes yoga one of the greatest gifts Mahadeva has given to the world!\n\n\nTranscript:\n\nLet me explain yoga. Adi Yogi Mahadeva revealed this science in the Shiva Agamas to the whole universe, as a science to awaken your inner potential energy. I don’t want to say the physical postures are not yoga, and I don’t want to say physical health is not purpose of yoga - that is also included. \n\nPlease understand, there is so much of confusion. As usual, anything practices by billions will have variations, confusions, debates - it is usual. Whether the physical postures are yoga. Please understand: physical postures are also yoga. It is not that they are not part of yoga, and I also do not want to say they are alone as yoga, no. Physical postures are not excluded, but that does not mean only physical postures are yoga. \n\nIt is a great science, where your body is trained to acchieve its peak potential through asanas. And mind is trained through liberated thinking. Your breathing structure is trained through pranayama. The various steps are used in yoga, ultimately, to awaken your kundalini shakti. Yoga is not meant just for your well being or health, it is meant to awaken your mystical powers. It is meant to awaken your spiritual realisation. Realising your spiritual identity is the ultimate goal of yoga. Kundalini is the inner potential energy. Once it is awakened, you will experience extraordinary health, physically, mentally, and extraordinary powers, abilities. Everything in yoga is finally aimed at: it can be as simple as washing your eyes. Or as difficult as Sirsasana or NIthya Douthi Kriyas. Everything is aimed at awakening the Kundalini Shakti in you. To awaken the extraordinary possibilities, and abilities in you. \n\nYoga is one of the greatest gift given to the world given by Mahadeva directly. Please understand, yoga is organised by Patanjali, but gifted by Mahadeva himself.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/yb4z_g7Srfk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"yb4z_g7Srfk","viewCount":8447,"eventDate":"2016-06-19","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"20"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"what-is-the-purpose-of-yoga-yb4zg7srfk"}}
