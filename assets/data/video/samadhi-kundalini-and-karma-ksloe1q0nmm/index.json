The first question asks him to define nirvikalpa samadhi and to give practices that can lead us to that state. Paramahamsa replies that nirvikalpa means undisturbed, unchanging inner space, and the current program in which the questioner is participating, Inner Awakening, provides exactly the training to achieve it. Second question is from a devotee who was able to travel to Mount Kailash last summer despite severe arthritis. She asks how Paramahamsa made it possible. He answers that since she had experienced kundalini awakening in his presence, her bio-memory now obeys his energy more strongly than hers, so he was able to correct her illness. The third question inquires whether conscious awareness exists in comatose accident victims, and whether they can work on their karma in such condition. Paramahamsa responds that if they had raised their consciousness prior to the injury they can effect spiritual work in a vegetative state; but if not, they will have to wait for the next birth to continue their evolution. The final questioner asks why people have thoughts of harming others. Paramahamsa remarks that usually there is no desire to harm, it is only the desire to expand one's boundary and this can intrude on others. He reminds us that we are each responsible for maintaining our boundaries and for negotiating intelligently when boundaries collide.\n\nTranscripts:-\n\nThe first question is from Sadhana, IA id no. 65. She is asking: \nQ: Dearest Swamiji, Please explain what is Nirvikalpa Samadhi? How can I attain it? Can one hold Prana outside the body at will, when one achieves ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’? Please guide me, what steps, what tapas, what kriya I perform to attain it. ---Sadhana- IA ID No.65 \nSwamiji:- Sadhana, please understand - ‘Nirvikalpa’ means being without any changes. ‘Vikalpa’ means changes, oscillation, diversion, dilution, differentiation. All these can be different meanings of the wordVikalpa. ‘Nirvikalpa’ means without any of this. When one achieves Nirvikalpa Samadhi, he literally becomes God. He becomes one with the ultimate. ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’ means your whole being, your whole identity dissolving into the cosmic existence. The individual inner space has no more disturbances, differences. Next question - How can I attain it? There are millions of methods, process, procedures. Pick up any one sincerely, authentically. You are already doing Inner Awakening, you are already initiated into unclutching. Best direct experience of Nirvikalpa Samadhi can be had by unclutching. Please understand, unclutching is not even a path leading to Nirvikalpa Samadhi, it is a process directly giving you the experience of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. The moment you start unclutching you are falling into Nirvikalpa Samadhi. It is not a peak to attain it, it is a valley in which you need to fall. It is not an object to attain it, peak to achieve it, it is a valley to be fallen in it. When one achieves Nirvikalpa Samadhi it is not even an achievement. Sadhana, to tell you honestly you are asking so many questions about Nirvikalpa Samadhi. But any answer about Nirvikalpa Samadhi will not be truthful when you achieve that sate. Now whatever I say when you start experiencing, you will only find my words are inadequate. If a common man, person who is on the road, who is a new seeker, if he asks this question, I can give elaborate answer because I know for sure this guy is not going to achieve it. It is like collecting maps. There are some fellows who are crazy about collecting maps but never travel, there are somefellows who are crazy about collecting menu cards, but never eat, crazy of collecting all the postal stamps, but never send anything, crazy of collecting coins, but will never spend anything, crazy of collecting swords, but doesn’t know how to fight. I know there are some people, crazy of collecting things, will never use it. Same way, if an onlooker or a person who is not that authentic or sincere, if he asks about this question, what is Nirvikalpa Samadhi, I can give poetries after poetries after poetries. I can sing any number of songs. He is not going to experiment it or experience it. But Sadhana you are already in the Inner Awakening. You are getting into Nirvikalpa Samadhi. So when I answer you – I wanted to be very responsible. Any word I give about Nirvikalpa Samadhi will be inadequate when you experience it! You are asking can one hold Praana outside the body at will when one achieves Nirvikalpa Samadhi. When you achieve Nirvikalpa Samadhi you can hold praana out, in, in and out, out and in, anywhere you want. What steps, what tapas, what kriya I perform to attain it? Sadhana, you are already doing it. Inner Awakening is the steps, Inner Awakening is the tapas, Inner Awakening is the kriya you need to perform to attain it and you are doing it.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kSLoE1Q0nmM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCbVA1U97LU1ec52liQJyov1_V6Ug","youtubeID":"kSLoE1Q0nmM","viewCount":13951,"eventDate":"2012-04-26","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"samadhi-kundalini-and-karma-ksloe1q0nmm"}}
