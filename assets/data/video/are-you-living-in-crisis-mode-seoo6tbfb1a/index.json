In fact, these two practices will help every aspect of our lives. When we intensely workout, building our body, we gain confidence in our ability to do any physical activity. And when we continuously practice completion, we reduce our thoughts, allowing us to act from intuition and a clear inner space.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, the 21st Inner Awakening, third day.\n\nAnd very important thing today, the Skanda Sashti Brahmotsavam, Subrahmanya's Skanda Sashti Utsava is beginning.  This is one of the very well-known popular vrata observed in South India, the most popular vrata observed in South India.  From the young age, I never used to miss this vrata. \n\nToday, as part of the first day of the Brahmotsavam, Subrahmanya is gracing us on the Golden Peacock, Swarna Mayura Vahana.....Swarna Mayura Vahana.\n\nToday is the day, Devi sends Subramanya with the weapon, the spear, with her whole energy as spear she sends him to kill the demons.  So, from Kailash, Subramanya comes on the peacock.\n\nAnd, in many parts of the country, today also we continue to celebrate Diwali.  Diwali is celebrated in some parts of the country today.\n\nIn San Jose we have Diwali today.  Thirty-six items are offered as naivedhyam.  Kali Puja is done.  Blessings!  Blessings for all you guys!\n\n \n\nLet me start today's satsangh.\n\nI am going to expand on \"THE POWER OF COMPLETION\". Please understand, our muscles carry memory and memories.  If your muscles carry a memory, you live a beautiful blissful life.  If your muscles carry memories, you are in a mess!  Listen! If your muscles carry a memory, you live a blissful life.  If it carries memories, you are in a mess!  The difference is, when there are too many memories sitting on the muscles creating a stress, complication, confusion, incompletions, it is almost like even to make one small decision you have to go through the whole Parliament.  It is literally democracy.  Please understand, democracy is great for a country; but for a body you cannot have democracy.  Just to move the right hand, just to move the right hand, the information, the file has to be prepared, a detailed resolution and it goes to the brain; then the liver supports, but the brain doesn't support; the heart vetoes, and kidneys say \"No!\".  After all these discussions, you have to move the right hand.  Will you move ever?  Democracy is not for the body. \n\nSo, please understand, democracy is great for a country; to run a country democracy is great, because multiple points of view need to be considered, because everyone's life is affected by the decisions made.  But, as far as your body is concerned, it's only YOUR life.  It's just YOUR life.  But, even with movements of the body if you start doing democratically, never, ever, any movements will happen.  If you are filled with too many incompletions and memories, this is what exactly will happen.\n\nMost of the time, you really don't know what you want.  How many of you feel, 'the whole problem in my life is I don't know what I want!'  (People raise their hands).  Oh, God!  90% of the hall!  Remaining 10% do not know even whether they know what they want, or they do not know what they want!  Even that they do not know!\n\nI tell you, identity crisis is always one of the biggest problems of human-beings.  Identity crisis, \"don't know what we want in life!  Don't know what we are doing in life!\"  If you don't know what you want in life, you are just waiting to die!  Be very clear, you are not living, you are waiting to die!  Waiting to die is not living. \n\nMany of you, if you look inside, you are just waiting to die.  You don't have the courage to commit suicide; so you are just dragging your days, time.  Please understand, that is not life.  You need to get it.  You need to understand.  When you bring Completion, you reduce the number of thoughts which precedes before a conclusion arrives.  It is like you reduce the screaming and shouting happening inside you.  The unparliamentary Parliament which you are running inside; the sound of that reduces, the sound comes down if you do Completion. \n\nPlease listen, if you come to a decision without a thought, you are living in the space of \"Intuition\".  If you come to a decision after multiple thoughts, it is \"Ignorance\".  If you come to a decision after one clear flow of thoughts, it is called \"Intelligence\".  If you come to a decision without any thought, it is called \"Intuition\".\n\nPlease understand, I really tell you, Completion is equivalent to inner cleansing.  All your muscle-memories come to peace and rest in peace.\n\nAnd, I also wanted you to know, I strongly discourage any of this bodily work getting done by the people whose muscle-memory is incomplete.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/seoO6TbFb1A/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBwGaVPNhqJBeL4jhWncL8_u2P4Rw","youtubeID":"seoO6TbFb1A","viewCount":3934,"eventDate":"2013-11-11","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-you-living-in-crisis-mode-seoo6tbfb1a"}}
