Karma is the decision against life, harassing us and putting us into incompletion. When we decide for live, all karmas, fears and negativity will clear. To be liberated form the bondage created by our deeds, there is no other way but to decide for life! \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will enter into the sutras directly. \n \nThe second verse of Ishavasya Upanishad:\n \nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \n“One should decide to live in this world for a hundred years, hundreds of years, all the while doing his deeds dispassionately as sanctioned by the scriptures. In this way, the deeds done by you shall not cling to you.  There is no other way by which a man can free himself from the bondage created by the deeds.”\n \nListen! Just in the last few days, one of our devotees, a doctor, she asked me a question: ‘How to practically combine all these, Swamiji?  We all know the truth. We understand that everything changes, including what we perceive, and even what we don’t perceive. How can we co-exist in Advaitha with our fellow beings, even if, either one of us, myself or others, do not accept the change as something necessary and good for all of us?’  This was the question.\n \nActually, the second line of the second verse is the answer.  Understand:\n \nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \nWhen you decide to LIVE, when you decide FOR LIFE based on the understanding “everything is Consciousness”.....\n \nSee, I will just give you a few types of mental setups: \n \n(MENTAL SETUP 1 – DECIDING AGAINST LIFE BECAUSE OF A FEW FAILURES, A FEW SMALL INCIDENTS):\n \nSome people decide AGAINST LIFE. Seeing the SUFFERING IN LIFE and by BECOMING POWERLESS TO FACE LIFE, they decide AGAINST LIFE, I tell you.  I can give you an example:\n \nAt the age of six, when you are in school, your teacher asks some question – ‘Who is the first Prime Minister of India?’ You put your hands up and jump and shout, ‘Mahatma Gandhi”. The whole class will be laughing at you.  And, at that time, you feel naturally, ‘Oh, I have done some something wrong. I should not be putting up my hand and jumping like this. I should keep quiet in a crowd.’ This decision, even after you become forty-seven, when you are sitting in a meeting, you are the CEO, even then, if you have an idea, you won’t speak out directly in the group, you will tell somebody else, and that person will tell the group, and he will get the name.  You decide for your whole future based on one incident! Look in. Thousands of decisions you have done, based on one incident, AGAINST LIFE. \n \nThe other day, I was talking to a devotee. \n \nI was telling him, ‘Hey, always remember you are Mahadeva, Shiva, and move the happenings of your life with this understanding.’ \n \nHe said, ‘No, Swamiji. I just have blood-pressure and sugar (diabetes). I tell myself, “I am Mahadeva!  Let this blood-pressure and sugar be healed!”  When that doesn’t heal, I lose confidence that I can change the other things.’\n \nListen!  This blood-pressure and sugar, you would have taken so many thousands of decisions AGAINST LIFE; that is why it came. So, now, when you decide FOR LIFE, decide at least a few times till that whole part starts listening to you. See, your decisions AGAINST LIFE has become a big chunk in you. You may not need to kill all of them, but you need to create the decision FOR LIFE at least to drive them enough!  See, each time, your decision AGAINST LIFE becomes one soldier against you.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/deciding-life-clears-all-karma#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3aRN3eiQyOI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"3aRN3eiQyOI","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"deciding-for-life-clears-all-karma-3arn3eiqyoi"}}
