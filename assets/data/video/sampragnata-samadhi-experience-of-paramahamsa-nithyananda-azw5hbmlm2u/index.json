On April 21st 2009, Paramahamsa Nithyananda delivered his first scheduled discourse on Patanjalis Yoga Sutra at the Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Houston, Texas. He commented on the seventeenth Patanjali Yoga Sutra. Nithyananda expressed deep gratitude for his upbringing in a small Indian temple village where his inner space was not corrupted and the vitarka (right reasoning) was able to flower. He narrated the beautiful incident from his biography (feeding the Ganapati idol in his young age). He said that the right reasoning helped him to connect very deeply to the Ganapati idol as pure energy, in so much that Ganapati was alive in front of him and ate the food he offered! Nithyananda declared this incident as his first experience of samprajnata samadhi.
