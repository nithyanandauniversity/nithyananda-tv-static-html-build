IN EVERY STEP OF YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU ARE BREATHING TYAGA, MANIFESTING TYAGA, YOU ARE BREATHING PARAMASHIVA HIMSELF. MAHAKALABHAIRAVA IS THE MANIFESTATION OF PARAMASHIVA’S TYAGA.\n\n*I AM GOING TO SHARE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL BHAIRAVAS COMPILED FROM VARIOUS AGAMAS, TANTRAS AND PURANAS PUBLISHED BY TIRUVAVADUTURAI AADHEENAM. I WANT TO THANK THE GURU MAHASANNIDHANAM OF TIRUVAVUDUTURAI AADHEENAM AND HIS EDITORIAL TEAM FOR DOING THIS GREAT WONDERFUL COMPILATION ON MAHAKALABHAIRAVA. MAHAKALABHAIRAVA IS THE ULTIMATE TYAGA - PARAMA TYAGA IN ALL OF US.\n\n*TODAY IS ALSO SRI RAMAKRISHNA’S BIRTHDAY! HE IS THE AVATARA VARISTHA! HE IS THE GREATEST INCARNATION OF PARAMASHIVA IN THE MODERN TIMES AND UNDOUBTEDLY, THE HIGHEST INFLUENCE ON ME NEXT TO ARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA!\n\n*SRI RAMAKRISHNA - HE IS THE ABSOLUTE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THE ABSOLUTE ATTRIBUTES OF THE ABSOLUTE! WHETHER YOU CALL IT PURITY, CONSCIOUSNESS, AUSPICIOUSNESS OR POWER MANIFESTATION, HE IS INCOMPARABLE!\n\n*FROM THE TIME I READ ‘RAMAKRISHANRIN AMUTHA MOZHIGAL’ IN TAMIL WHICH WAS MY INSPIRATION, FROM THAT DAY TILL NOW, HE IS ONE OF MY ARADHANA MURTIS, MEANS IN MY PERSONAL WORSHIP ALTAR, HE IS ALWAYS THERE AND WORSHIPPING HIM WAS AND IS PART OF MY LIFE EVERYDAY, EVEN TODAY.\n\n*THE FIRST ASHRAM I BUILT WAS DEDICATED TO HIS NAME - ‘SRI RAMAKRISHNA DHYANAPEETAM’. SO WE ARE CELEBRATING HIS JAYANTI IN SRI RAMAKRISHNA DHYANAPEETAM AND IN ALL OUR ASHRAMS, AADHEENAMS, SARVAJNAPEETHAMS. LET US OFFER ARATI IN SRI RAMAKRISHNA DHYANAPEETAM, TIRUCHENGODE AADHEENAM.\n\n*FROM THE CONTEXT OF ‘YOU ARE PARAMASHIVA’, WHEN YOU DO TYAGA IN ANY LEVEL, WHETHER YOU GIVE UP ONE MEAL, OR YOU GIVE UP WHATEVER YOU CALL AS WEALTH, ANYTHING, YOU START INFUSING YOURSELF WITH PARAMASHIVA PRANA AND YOU BECOME MAHAKALABHAIRAVA!\n\n*LIKE HOW IF YOU FILL THE BALLOON WITH HELIUM GAS, IT GOES UP, IF YOU FILL YOURSELF WITH THE TYAGA, PRANA OF PARAMASHIVA, YOU GO TO KAILASA!\n\n*WHEN PARAMASHIVA MANIFESTS HIS TYAGA DIMENSION, HE IS WORSHIPPED AS MAHAKALABHAIRAVA. KALABHAIRAVA NEVER PUNISHES. HE ONLY HELPS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR PRAMASHIVATVA. IN THE BRAHMA STORY, IF HE WAS ANGRY, HE WOULD HAVE KILLED BRAHMA. BUT INSTEAD, HE JUST REMOVED BRAHMA’S EGO WHICH STOPS BRAHMA FROM SEEING THE ULTIMATE REALITY, FROM SEEING HIS PARAMASHIVATVA. HE HELPED HIM TO ACHIEVE HIS ULTIMATE STATE ETERNALLY.\n\n*KALABHAIRAVA IS ETERNAL COMPASSION, ETERNALLY SWEET AND CUTE. YOU CAN TICKLE HIS HIP WHEN YOU SEE HIM AND HE WILL LAUGH! TO HIDE THAT CUTENESS HE STANDS FEROCIOUSLY! HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT. HE IS THE ULTIMATE TYAGI, TYAGARAJA!\n\n*PARAMASHIVA HIMSELF GAVE THESE SACRED SOUNDS TO AWAKEN THAT TYAGARAJA IN ALL OF US. I AM GOING TO AWAKEN DIFFERENT ENERGIES OF PARAMASHIVA, OF KALABHAIRAVA, IN ALL OF US. I AM GOING TO RECITE THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS AS IT IS, TO CONNECT ALL OF US TO PARAMASHIVA AND SHRIKAILASA. WITH THE GRACE OF PARAMASHIVA, ALL OF US WILL EXPERIENCE PARAMASHIVA TODAY. CALL ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES FOR THE PROCESS TODAY. IT WILL HELP INTENSELY MANIFESTING POWERS, ESPECIALLY AKASHIC RECORD. YOU CAN START READING AKASHIC RECORDS.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:\n\nFIRST QUESTION FROM KATHY ANN: DEAR SWAMIJI, HOW DO I MAINTAIN FOCUS WHEN STRUGGLES ARISE TO THROW ME OFF MY PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT?\n\n*DO NOT WORRY THAT YOU DID NOT HAVE INSPIRATION IN YOUR PAST AND DO NOT WORRY ABOUT RETAINING IT IN THE FUTURE. NOW, IF YOU KNOW, JUST TAKE OFF! THIS IS A CUSTOMISED ANSWER FOR YOU. WITH THIS DECISION, MOVE TO KAILASA! THE FOCUS WILL BE KEPT ALIVE!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Zswu43czr58/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Zswu43czr58","viewCount":7531,"eventDate":"2020-02-25","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"connecting-to-kalabhairava-to-achieve-paramashivatva-zswu43czr58"}}
