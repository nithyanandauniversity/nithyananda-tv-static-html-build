PARAMASHIVA! CONSCIOUSLY WHAT I KNOW AS ME, WITH THAT WHOLE.. MY CORE BEING..I DECLARE, I SURRENDER MYSELF TO YOU. PRABHO! MAHADEVA! PARAMASHIVA! MANIFEST THROUGH ME. LET ONENESS HAPPEN BETWEEN YOU AND WHAT I KNOW AS ME.”\n\n*JUST THIS SIMPLE DECLARATION, CONNECTION IS ENOUGH. AFTER THAT, THERE IS NO CONDITION THAT YOU HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, THAT WAY…\n\n*YOU HAVE YOUR OWN FALSE SCALES, IDEAS, CONDITIONS, WHICH START SELF-DOUBT, SELF-HATRED, SELF-DENIAL IN YOU.\n\n*YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SAY, “PARAMASHIVA! I SURRENDER TO YOU,” A LIGHT SHOULD FLASH AND HE SHOULD APPEAR AND SAY, “O SON! I ACCEPTED YOU! SIT ON MY LAP!” ALL YOUR IDEAS ABOUT HOW PARAMASHIVA SHOULD REACT IS STUPID.\n\n*HE MANIFESTS IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS OWN WAY.\n\n*TODAY I WAS IN SUCH SAMADHI AND ECSTACY, I LITERALLY PULLED MYSELF OUT OF MY SEAT AND MADE ME SIT HERE. EVEN IF YOU GIVE BILLION DOLLARS I WILL NOT COME OUT OF THIS SAMADHI!\n\n*ONE OF THE BIGGEST ENEMIES STOPPING YOU FROM EXPERIENCING NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI IS YOUR SELF-CRITICISING PATTERN. YOU STRONGLY BELIEVE YOU HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ONENESS, NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI, UNCLUTCHING, COMPLETION, BECAUSE THERE IS A DEFINITION FOR THAT STATE AND THAT DEFINITION IS NOT MANIFESTING IN YOU.\n\n*ANY PERSON WHO THINKS THERE IS A DEFINITION FOR NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI, FOR ONENESS, IS A FOOL. YOUR MIND CANNOT GRASP EVEN THE DEFINITION! FORGET ABOUT USING THE DEFINITION AS A SCALE TO MEASURE WHETHER YOU HAVE ACHIEVED IT OR NOT!\n\n*YOU CAN DO ONLY ONE THING: CONTINUOUSLY REMEMBER TO SURRENDER. CONSCIOUSLY DECLARE: “I AM CONSCIOUSLY DECLARING. MANIFESTING IN ME ONLY YOU CAN DO.”\n\n*RAMANA MAHARISHI BEAUTIFULLY SINGS IN AKSHARAMANAMALAI:\n\nஆருக்கா எனை அண்டனை அகற்றிடில்\nஅகிலம் பழித்திடும் அருணாசலா !\n\nஇப்பழி தப்பு, உனை ஏன் நினைப்பித்தாய்\nஇனியார் விடுவார் அருணாசலா !\n\nĀ RUK KĀ VENAI YĀN DANAIYAHATRIDIL AKILAM PAZHITTIDUM ARUNĀCHALĀ.\nIPPAZHITAPPUNAI ĒNNINAIP PITTĀY INIYĀR VIDUVĀR ARUNĀCHALĀ.\n\n*THE WHOLE SCENE IS ACTUALLY IN MADHURA BHAVA!\n\n*ONE OF THE WIVES OF KRISHNA, WHEN SHE WAS WITH THE PARENTS AND SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH KRISHNA, SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME AND MARRY KRISHNA. SHE SENDS MESSAGE TO KRISHNA: “PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU.” KRISHNA PLANS AND GOES AND GETS HER. THIS IS THE EXACT MOOD WITH WHICH BHAGAVAN IS DESCRIBING THE FIRST FEW VERSES!\n\n*THIS WHOLE SCENE OF KRISHNA AND KRISHA’S WIFE IS EXACTLY THE THING THAT HAPPENS IN LIFE. KRISHNA’S WIFE IS THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL - ALL OF US. KRISHNA IS PARAMASHIVA. WE CAN ONLY DECLARE TO PARAMASHIVA, “I WANT TO EXPERIENCE ONENESS WITH YOU.” HOW HE WILL MANIFEST IN YOU, ONLY HE KNOWS! IF YOU HAVE A SCALE HOW HE SHOULD MANIFEST IN YOU AND USING THAT IF YOU BEAT YOURSELF IN SELF-DOUBT, SELF-HATRED, SELF-DOUBT, YOU PUT YOURSELF MORE AND MORE IN SUICIDAL ARROGANCE. SUICIDAL ARROGANCE IS WORSE THAN DEPRESSION.\n\n*THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IS: DECLARE TO PARAMASHIVA: “PRABHO! REALLY, I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE WAY YOU EXIST. BUT AS PER YOUR DECLARATION IN VEDAS AND AGAMAS AND MY GURU’S CONFIRMATION, I HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT HOW YOU EXIST. WHETHER THAT IDEA IS COMPLETE OR NOT I DO NOT KNOW, BUT WHAT I KNOW AS ME I SURRENDER UNTO YOU. I OFFER ME TO YOU. PLEASE YOU TAKE AWAY ME IN YOU. LET YOU RADIATE. LET YOU ONLY EXIST. LET ME EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTE NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI, UNCLUTCHING, COMPLETE COMPLETION OR WHATEVER HIGHEST STATE - I MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THE NAME OR WORD TO DESCRIBE. LET ME EXPERIENCE THAT.”\n\n*DECLARE IT CONSCIOUSLY. EVEN IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUSLY ENJOYING SOMEBODY SWIMMING, HIS NEURON ACTIVITY IS MIRRORED IN YOU. IF EVEN ORDINARY SWIMMING IS MIRRORED, CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND: THE GREATEST COSMIC EXISTENCE PARAMASHIVA... WHEN YOU SURRENDER TO HIM, WILL HIS NEURON ACTIVITY NOT MIRROR IN YOU?\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4151939071560578","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/t1mUn7jmAL4/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"t1mUn7jmAL4","viewCount":9200,"eventDate":"2020-07-26","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"how-to-experience-nirvikalpa-samadhi-the-oneness-with-paramashiva-t1mun7jmal4"}}
