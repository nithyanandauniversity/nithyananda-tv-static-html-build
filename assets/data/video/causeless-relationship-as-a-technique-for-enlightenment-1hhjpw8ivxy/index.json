In this clip, Swamiji tells us how relationships can lead you to enlightenment through the story of Meera.    Meera, who was an Indian princess and Krishna lived almost 2,000-3,000 years apart.  Through the inspirational story of Krishna, Swamiji gives us an understanding of true love.  He says that when you are truly in love with another being, you will feel he or she is god or divine.  Swamiji tells us that only causeless relationship can lead us to our being.  It is a relationship without any cause; it is a relationship purely for the sake of the other being.  Shiva is giving us yet another technique to use causeless relationships to lead us to our true self.
