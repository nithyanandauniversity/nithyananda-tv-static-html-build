In this clip taken from Patanjali Yoga Sutras discourse 11 (Sutra 14), Swamiji expounds on the word \"Dirgakalah\" that Patanjali uses to describe the practice of a technique for a long time.  Swamiji says that Patanjali does not use this word to cheat us.  In fact Patanjali knows the intricacies of the workings of the mind.  Unless the mind knows and is convinced that the practtioner commits to doing a practice indefinitely, mind will continue to postpone and cheat.  Swamiji sheds more light on this paradoxical truth giving example from the life of Buddha.  After 12 years of penance it is only when Buddha decides that he will sit forever to attain enlightenment, he dropped into the present moment and got enlightened at that very moment.  Swamiji then goes on to shed more light on this paradox by describing the concepts of chronological versus psychological times.
