He described how consciousness liberates us from matter and helps us to realize the decisive component of life and expands your ability to enrich you and enrich others. Satsanga is the right group experiencing the ultimate reality together. He reminded us that our spiritual growth depends on our ability to speak into the others' and into our own listening.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday, Nithyanandotsava third day celebrations!  Today we are also celebrating the Leela of feeding Ganesha. In Bidadi, the Utsava Murthy of Paramahamsa Nithyananda is decorated, reminding this Leela of feeding Ganesha, in Suvarna Sesha Vahana -- means, Golden Sesha Vahana.\n\nAnd, today, Rudra Homa and 1008 Shankhabhisheka in Bidadi. Rudra Homa 6pm Indian Standard time.\n\nToday, 20th day of Inner Awakening! Today we are going to work on the ultimate reality, Chit Jata Granthi Bhedana; means, realizing you are pure consciousness.  That is the ultimate reality! Today we will be working on that. Tomorrow, establishing yourself in that very state.\n\nBeing established in the ultimate reality is Sahaja, Sangha. The state of Sahaja happens in you with the right Sangha.  What is actually Satsangha?  Satsangha is nothing but being with a person or space where the Truth is again infused into you.  If you have the right people around you, right Sangha around you, spending time with everyone is Satsangha.  How many of you really found now your whole group has become Satsangha for you?  That's all!  Just learn the art of creating this group wherever you are.  Don't doubt your spouse can never be made into this group. Don't doubt your son can never be. No!  Your family, your colleagues, your team, your spouse, everyone can become Satsangha, can become part of you.  We will be doing the Sangha Sankalpa tomorrow.  Today we will work on the ultimate reality, how the Chit and Jata is separated, Chit Jata Granthi Bhedana happens, Chit and Jata, Chit Jata Granthi Bhedana happens.\n\nPlease listen. Chit -- Consciousness, Jata -- Matter. Unfortunately, you connect both and get confused. Chit Jata Granthi Bhedana means liberating your consciousness from matter; I can say, helping you wake up that decisive component of life, helping you to realize the decisive component of life. Satsangha means infusing this truth again and again into you.  I tell you, the essence of all the satsanghs of this year -- I said I will be giving you the essence in the next few satsanghs -- essence of all the satsanghs this year, essence of all the satsanghs I have ever done from my birth is nothing but just this message.  Please listen, it is all about increasing your capability to infuse the truth in you and others; that's all!  Increasing the capability to enrich you and enriching others; that's all! That is all is the essence of life on the Planet Earth, essence of life in the Universe. Essence of life in the Universe is neither money nor infrastructural development, or just some social power, or relationships. The essence of human life, goal of human life, purpose of life in the Universe is expanding your ability to infuse the great spiritual truths in you, enriching you and enriching others.  That's all!  Ability to enrich you and enrich others! It is all just the strength with which you enrich yourself, the strength with which you enrich others.  \n\nThis whole Inner Awakening Level-4 is nothing but awakening your strength to enrich you and awakening your strength to enrich others, that's all; not just intelligence and inspiration, even the skill! Sometimes intelligence is different, skill is different. Intelligence, when it is applied it becomes skill. Tomorrow, after the satsangh, first time we are going to have \"Glimpses of my Inner Awakening\".  Means, all of you are going to share your Inner Awakening experience with the world. Tomorrow I'll give little time during the satsangh itself.  I will give you guys a little time.  \n\nEnd of the day, your success is dependent on your ability to speak into the listener's listening; your spiritual progress is dependent on your ability to speak into the listening of you and your ability to listen to your speaking.  Your ability to listen to you and your ability to speak into the listening of you decides your spiritual growth.\nMany times, people come and tell me, 'I am not able to convince myself to drop my incompletions.' Means, you are not able to speak into your listening.\n\nSpeak into your listening.  Speak into your listening. Speak into your listening.  There is no shortcut, there is no cross cut.  Shortest distance between two points is straight line.  So, shortest route for anything is straight line and straight path, straight route.  Ability to speak into the listening of yourself is Completion. Please understand, I am defining Completion.  Ability to speak into the listening of yourself is ability to complete.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PU2O2OARrRM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCFlyyzct84cbtCjZVz4HLRgiWPfA","youtubeID":"PU2O2OARrRM","viewCount":2015,"eventDate":"2013-12-20","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-you-listening-to-yourself-pu2o2oarrrm"}}
