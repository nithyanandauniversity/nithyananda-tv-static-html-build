The main message -- \"Bring Light into your Darkness\". Yes, it is directly possible to bring light by simply avoiding ignorance and by living in a space where we don't confuse matter and consciousness, where only pure inner space remains. Nithyananda beautifully termed this space as \"Unified Field -- Advaita Samrajya, Advaita anubhuti\" . This 'Oneness', he elaborated is not some verbal concept, it is a living reality. \nThis can be achieved by the practice of 'avoiding ignorance' in life at all costs. He reminded us again not to make any decisions, any strategy planning based on incomplete, illogical, irresponsible logic and its inconclusive conclusions. This can directly lead us to Enlightenment itself! And \"Suddenly you will see the very idea that you are body will be questioned by you. So whole thing will tumble down. You will fall into the space of unified field.\"\nNot only success and peace in the outer world, success and peace in the inner world will happen in you.\nIn His words, He shared the ultimate technique to solve any problem. He says, \"I tell you, having clarity about moral problems as moral, political as political, legal as legal, spiritual as spiritual, economical as economical is Energy. When energy happens in you, first this clarity comes to you. Chaotic union does not happen in you. It is just energy.\" \n\"Energy brings intelligence, intelligence brings energy. It's like a virtuous cycle. If you are more energetic you became more intelligent, if you are more intelligent you became more energetic.\"\nIn conclusion he stressed: Avoid ignorance. As a result there will not be confusion between matter and consciousness. You will be in the pure inner space. \"When you go on making decisions, strategies, with conclusive logic, the conclusive restful awareness, anything that happens after that you will have the intelligence to stand up. No attack can shake you. Stirred not shaken. If you go on making decisions based on your logical conclusions maybe somebody will try to stir you but nobody can shake you.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FueiE00ZjeY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBfTTYw9EENceXMdb9zUqXt12Zfrw","youtubeID":"FueiE00ZjeY","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"22"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"bring-light-to-your-darkness-patanjali-yoga-sutras-76-nithyananda-morning-satsang-07-dec-2010-fueie00zjey"}}
