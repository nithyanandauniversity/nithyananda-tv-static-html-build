We can wake up and utilize our power of words, thinking, feeling, and living by practicing the four spiritual truths or Tattvas: Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility, and Enriching. Let us wake up our powers by practicing the Tattvas, remembering never to give up on ourselves or others!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings! \n\nToday, Mahadeva is gracing us in the Leela Dhyána: HOW SUNDARESHWARA GIVES DARSHAN IN MADURAI TO A CHOLA KING.\n\nNot only the Pandyas, even the Chola kings were devotees of Sundareshwara.\n\nThere was a Chola king who was a great devotee of Sundareshwara and he really, really wanted to have darshan of Sundareshwara. But unfortunately, because Pandyas and Cholas were enemies, he could not go to Madurai to have darshan of Sundareshwara. \n\nSundareshwara appeared in his dream and said, 'Alright, you come in the night and I will give you darshan.' As per Sundareshwara's instructions, the king goes to Madurai at night. Sundareshwara appears as a mystic and opens the doors of the temple secretly and arranges for his darshan, gives darshan to the king. \n\nThe moment the Chola king has darshan, Sundareshwara sends him back. After locking the door, as a symbol that He did this Leela (divine play), Sundareshwara removes the Pandya's Fish Symbol Flag (Meen Kodi) from the temple tower, (the royal insignia of the Pandyas); and puts the Rishabha Flag, His own flag, Shiva's own flag, and disappears.\n\nNext morning, when the Pandya king got up, the whole Pandya kingdom is shocked! How can the flag be changed suddenly? \n\nThe Pandya king was shocked and goes and asks Sundareshwara.\n\nSundareshwara appears and tells Pandya king the whole thing, and actually all that happened.\n\nSo today, let us have the leela dhyána and remember the Leela of Sundareshwara. Opening His temple doors secretly for a devotee's sake and giving darshan!\n\nToday:\n\n• 20th batch Inner Awakening, 8th day;\n\n• 17th batch eN-Genius, 8th day;\n\n• 19th batch Nirahara Samyama, Level-2, 5th day;\n\n• 20th batch Nirahara Samyama-break. Tomorrow, we will start Level-2;\n\n• 9Th batch The Samyama, 8th day; \n\nAnd, today, one more important auspicious day -- Mahálaya Amavasya. Why I said \"auspicious\", because from today Navaratri Brahmotsava starts.  We will be raising the flag, may be today evening or tomorrow. The timing will be announced. \n\nAnd, today is one more important thing. Today, Hindus offer Completion to the departed souls, elders, parents. The shraaddha, oblations to the departed ancestors is done today. Today is a very important day. Surya (Sun) enters into Kanya Ráshi (Virgo), and the ancestors descend on the earth to accept the respects and rites, oblations, from all human-beings. Today is the auspicious day to offer Maheshwara Puja, and we will be having Maheshwara Puja here in Bidadi. And, I also request all our Sangha to offer Maheshwara Puja, if you have our sannyasis staying in your place, like Los Angeles, Toronto, New York. Wherever our sannyasis are staying, I request our Sangha to offer Maheshwara Puja to our sannyasis and sannyasinis. Today, feeding any sadhu, giving food to any sannyasi, directly leads you to Completion with the ancestors who have left the body. So, it is a very good thing. If you don't find our sannyasis, at least the people who have taken sannyas formally and who live sannyas with Integrity, offer food to them; even that will lead you to Completion with the ancestors. \n\nToday, at noon, 1:30 pm Indian Standard Time, you can see the Maheshwara Puja live on Nithyananda TV. All the devotees can see Maheshwara Puja live on Nithyananda TV, and whoever sees today the Maheshwara puja, I will give all of you guys the punya of feeding the sadhus and doing Maheshwara Puja!  Even if you see today, you will have the Punya of shraaddha and Completion with ancestors. And, if you want to offer Maheshwara Puja, you can e-mail programs@nithyananda.org or call the number appearing on the screen (+91 80 2727 9999).\n\nAlright! I will move to today's Nithya Satsangh. Today, I wanted to speak about the important powers which are given to us, but still we have not\n\nstarted using. As human-beings, all of us are given as a default program certain powers!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DCfgGMplgc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBnwiZ-z_pgjDWckF5Ye5J5uO5Uag","youtubeID":"0DCfgGMplgc","viewCount":12694,"eventDate":"2013-10-04","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"5"},{"id":"19"},{"id":"31"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"your-key-to-mystical-powers-0dcfggmplgc"}}
