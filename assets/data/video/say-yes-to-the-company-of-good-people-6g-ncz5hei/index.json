Continuously check if you are with people who are saying yes to life; for even just being in the company of good people, we can become enlightened!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLet us enter into third verse of Ishavasya Upanishad.  I will continue to expand on it, because so many questions need to be answered, so many answers need to be questioned.\n\n \n\nअसुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः ।\n\nताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥\n\nAsurya naama they lokaa andhena thamasaavruthaah |\n\nThaagumsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah ||\n\n\nListen!  “Athmahana”, saying “NO” to life, leads to the lower levels of existence, “Dussangha”, company of the lower level people.  I tell you, that is the hell!  That is the hell!  Company of the lower level people, because, they will somehow brainwash you to get into their space, and they will make you do what they want you to do.  Finally, they will put you in trouble; then they will escape; because they are very shrewd.  They will escape so that they will go and haunt the other person.\n\nOne fellow, very popular preacher of suicide theology, he will preach, teach, literally mesmerize, hypnotise everyone to commit suicide, and lot of people have started committing suicide.  Teaching death is very easy.  That is why all death-based concepts spread like a wildfire.  All the death-based religions, concepts, killing yourself and killing others, they spread like a wildfire.  But the life-based religions, concepts, take lot of time.  The best life-based religion in toto, hundred percent, is Jainism.  The pure, life-based religion, Ahimsa and life, saying “YES” to life!  But how much struggle that religion has to go through to spread!  Actually, there are no followers; literally there are no followers of Jainism.  That is the truth.  Except a handful of monks, a few people!  Because, it is life-based, doesn’t spread that wildly.  But all death-based concepts, they just spread like wildfire! \n\nPlease understand, billions of animals are killed every year for our food.  Still I can’t imagine how will you kill somebody for your snack?!  How will you kill somebody for your snack?!!  It takes a lot of time to accept life-based truths, understandings.  It is very easy to receive and teach, spread death-based ideas and concepts, because, it is all agitating.  Agitation is misunderstood as excitement.  \n\nThis suicide theology fellow, he spreads so much, and people commit suicide!\n\nSomebody asked, ‘Why are YOU not committing suicide?  You are teaching to so many people!’\n\nHe said, ‘No, if I die, then who will teach this idea and make more and more people commit suicide?’\n\nDussangha!  Understand, biggest warning this Upanishad is giving is “Dussangha”, the “wrong company”.\n\nअसुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः ।\nताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥\nAsurya naama they lokaa andhena thamasaavruthaah |\nThaagumsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah ||\n\nLower-grade worlds, abodes of demonic people, “asurya”, asuras, understand?\n\nOnce, when I was in Ramakrishna Mission, I met a very senior sadhu, a great “thapasvi”.  His name is Nandananda, Swami Nandanandaji.  Great “thapasvi”!  Very rarely I have seen “thapasvi” of his calibre!  Actually, he has a little difficulty in hearing; not a little, lot of difficulty.  Literally he can’t hear!  But he is such a beautiful, innocent being, he is almost like a deaf grand-father of the whole family!  If there is a deaf grand-father in the family, how these grand-kids will tease him and play around him and go near him, shout, scream, and make fun.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/say-yes-company-good-people#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_6G-nCz5heI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"_6G-nCz5heI","viewCount":5516,"eventDate":"2015-02-22","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"say-yes-to-the-company-of-good-people-6g-ncz5hei"}}
