He told us that to bring energy, consciousness and kundalini shakti into the reality of our life we need only completion and space creation. It's impossible is something that is told to us time and time again and it is a lie. We can kindle our kundalini by completing with the idea it's impossible again and again. Complete, complete, complete and anything is possible.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, the 7th day of the Nithyananda Brahmotsava, Rathotsava.  So, today evening, Nithyanandeshwara will be taken in procession in the chariot in the ashram.  And, He is gracing us with Nithyanandeshwari on the 7th day of the Brahmotsavam.\n\nWith this, I'll expand on the same subject I was explaining yesterday about COMPLETION and CREATING A SPACE. \n\nI can say, this is the essence of all the essence of my messages.  As essence of my messages I have given so many messages; as essence of the Vedic tradition I have given so many messages.  Now I can say, all those messages' essence is this: \"Using your Atma Jnana, using your Conscious Energy, using your Peak Possibility and making it into reality, making it into life.\"\n\nPlease listen!\n\nLife in its peak possibility, life in its peak energy!  Please listen!  Fortunately, in all of us, in all of us, however low, depressed you feel, however unworthy you feel, however angry, guilt you feel towards you and towards the world, in all of us the pure consciousness exists.  That pure consciousness can be brought to our day-to-day utility.  Means, you can bring that pure consciousness and make it for day-to-day use, make it for the day-to-day action. \n\nPlease understand, nothing is useful till you make it useful in your everyday routine.  Even if you have a billion dollars in the Swiss Bank and you are not able to use it every day in your life, that is not making you rich in your day-to-day life, then what is the use?  Almost all your spiritual energy, all your soul consciousness-Atman, is Swiss Bank money only!  It has no direct use for you in everyday life.  It is there; you only know the number of the bank account; but if you go and tell the petrol bunk guy or the hotel guy, 'I have a bank account in Swiss Bank, which has billion dollars, this is the account number, can you give me a little food?' he won't give you!  Even if he makes sure you have the money, he will give as a business deal that you will pay him back and not because you have. \n\nPlease listen!  How the money which is not brought to day-to-day use, whether you have it or not it is not useful to you. Same way the energy which you have not brought to your day-to-day use, the energy which you have not brought to your day-to-day use, even if it is there, there is no use; even if you are having it, there is no use.  Please listen, even if you are having it, there is no use.  All I am trying to give you now through this satsangh is, the energy, consciousness, Kundalini power which all of you have, all of us have, I am giving you the practical methodology to make it into your day-to-day life reality; to make this into your day-to-day life actuality; how to make that as part of your life; how to make this as reality of your life.\n\nPlease listen!  In two words I am giving you the gist:  \"Completion\" and \"Creation of Space\".  Completion again and again and again; how many times your being tries to get the idea of \"impossibility\" back to you, please listen, your being is such, it will again and again and again try to get this idea of \"impossible\" back to you.  This idea of \"impossibility\" will be again and again told to you.  That is the worst part!  That is the worst thing in life! \n\nYour mind will be alive, please listen, only as long as conflicts are alive; politicians and lawyers will have joy.  So, the job of politicians and lawyers is not to solve the conflict, but to keep the conflict alive as long as possible.  Same way, only as long as confusion exists, media will have job.  Media's job is not to solve the conflicts, solve the confusion.  No! It is to keep it alive as juicy as possible, keep the chaos alive, keep the confusion alive as juicy as possible.  They want confusion alive; chaos alive constantly. Confusion and chaos have to be kept alive for their business to flourish! No ethics!\n\nI have seen these rowdies in the name of media. I tell you, Oh, God!  One of the worst things in Indian media is eighty percent of them are uneducated.  Only twenty percent guys are qualified.  Eighty percent uneducated!  When I say \"uneducated\", they may be educated in some graduation, but professionally they would not have done degrees in Journalism or anything.  And they have no ethics!  Just bulldoze, abuse!  To get the eye-balls, to get the TRP, anything is okay!  Most unethical business!  Keeping the confusion alive is their responsibility.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_uTI5Het4U/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCbbXhVTlkWPc8cYHnI9ZFSGgV5MQ","youtubeID":"d_uTI5Het4U","viewCount":2327,"eventDate":"2013-11-16","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"impossibility-is-a-crime-duti5het4u"}}
