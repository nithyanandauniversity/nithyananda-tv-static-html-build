Paramahamsa Nithyananda enters into verse 8, intercepting into the qualities of Pure Consciousness, giving us the right direction for internalizing what we are supposed to do to experience Consciousness. Our ability, our expertise of the brain to catch, experience Consciousness only defines our spiritual growth. All spiritual practices are done to develop the subtle brain grooves in us to grasp the Pure Consciousness, which is all-pervasive, beyond space, ocean, or anything we can visualize or verbalize. How much ever we grasp It, that much only we can experience Consciousness. Every contemplation on Consciousness, gives us a better, deeper, subtler ‘click’. These clicks getting refined is spiritual growth.\n\nHe also declares that deciding to have him as the Guru, transformation become the basic need. It is all about Enlightenment, the experience of uncompromising Pure Consciousness, beyond Life and Death, beyond mind-body - it is 'the other world.' \nIsha Upanishad – Verse 8\nsa paryagāc-chukram akāyam avraṇam  asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham |\nkavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr   yathātathyato-arthān vyadadhāc-chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ || 8 ||\n \n\nToday’s Vākyārtha Sadas, topic for spiritual explorations on truth is – Meditate only on the first line - “Pure Consciousness is all-pervasive beyond the coming and going, absolute radiant and self-effulgent- sa paryagāc-chukram” – the qualities of Pure Consciousness. The description itself needs to be meditated on. What is the meaning of each of these words; what is all-pervasive? Is it beyond space, earth, water, fire – these are not all-pervasive. Then what is it that is subtler than the space, which is all-pervasive? Consciousness always tastes itself only by Itself. Meditate on the Consciousness. Contemplate on this Truth, think morning to evening. Meditate on it.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/-l1GZQm7I5Y/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"-l1GZQm7I5Y","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"catch-the-pure-consciousness-l1gzqm7i5y"}}
