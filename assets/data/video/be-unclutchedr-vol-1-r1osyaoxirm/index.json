This clip is taken from the discourse titled, \"Unclutching速 -- De-program the inner self\" delivered during the third day of the first Nithya Dhyan mass satsang held in Bangalore in December 2007.  In this clip Swmaiji gives us the essence of his teachings through the modern day mahavakya (great truth)-- \"Be Unclutched速\".  He unravels the truths about makeup of the mind and how we are clutching and creating joy or suffering.  He beautifully describes how we create thoughts, how we connect thoughts and experience life.  He tells us the first profound truth that there are so many thoughts that are moving in front of us, but our awareness is not always shining on the thoughts flowing in front of us.  As such many life changing decisions are made by us without awareness.  Every single moment that passes in our life without our being aware causes suffering us either directly or indirectly.  Swamiji then goes on to discuss the second profound truth.
