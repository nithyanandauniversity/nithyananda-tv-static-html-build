What is the alchemy process to save ourself from this Pralaya, deluge, pandemic, eco pandemic, Pandemic Fatigue and all the effects of pandemic. \nHDH explains knowing the chemistry of this Pralaya, you can protect yourself from this Pralaya. Pralaya, is delusion. What usually delusion does to your system is the chemistry. How this delusion impacts your inner chemistry ? The first impact of delusion will be extreme mood swings, feeling disconnected even with the purpose of your existence and life. \nHDH Shares, That is why I am insisting this till December 14th, bring more and more love, joy, Completion, Unclutching. Take my words very seriously. Every word I am uttering is really, really, uttered with extreme sincerity. Unclutching, completion, not sleeping more than six hours; all these are too important for you to keep yourself together at least till December, till December 14th. Extreme violence inside-outside, murderous, suicidal, will be the normal flow due to this Pralaya. \nDue to this Pralaya, deluge - your past violence, karmas, everything will be triggered from the source. It is also good news if you can use this opportunity to complete with all the unknown incompletions which will now gush out, which will now ooze out due to this deluge. When there is a collective deluge, Pralaya, even the deepest layers of your patterns, incompletions, all will ooze out. So, if you practice Absolute Completion, Non-Violence, non-reaction, no response internally, externally for all the incompletions, patterns coming out, erupting out, gushing out, oozing out; if you go for UNCLUTCHING this Pralaya, this pandemic time will give you SUPERCONSCIOUS BREAKTHROUGH, Enlightenment, Powers; and not only you will sail through this pandemic, Pralaya; you will give a Superconscious Breakthrough to others by setting a trend.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
