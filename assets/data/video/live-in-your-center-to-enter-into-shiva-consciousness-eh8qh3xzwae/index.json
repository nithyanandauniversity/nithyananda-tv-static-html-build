In this clip, Swamiji tells us Shiva in this sutra is giving us a technique to explode into our inner space.  The reason for all problems is we are not living in our center.  This clip is taken from Shiva Sutras discourse titled, Love the way to your being.  We sometimes have glimpses of our center, our very core, but we run away from this center.  We contantly move away from our center to the periphery.  Infact we do not even stay at the periphery, we tend to stay somewhere in between our center and periphery.  When you are at your center we are Shiva or Buddha or Krishna.  When we are at our periphery, we are mad.  By lingering in the intermediate zone, you are neither in Shiva consciousness nor you are mad  you become what is called the Human consciousness in this intermediate zone.  In this sutra Shiva tells s that just by entering into a relationship you can move to your center, to the zone of Shiva consciousness.
