Double Intelligence is the logic with which we handle others and the logic with which we handle ourselves. When we can assimilate the psychodrama that we create inside with the psychodrama that exists outside, we have completed with both sides, removing the blind spots which allows us to create the space for what we want - making it a reality in our lives!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings!\n\nToday I will expand on \"how the space you create becomes reality, sometimes why it fails, and how you can remove all these obstacles and make it into reality\".\n\nPlease listen!\n\nUnfortunately, human-beings strongly believe, unfortunately human-beings strongly cognize that double-intelligence is the best strategy.  Please listen, I am introducing a new word -- \"double-intelligence\".  This word you need to internalize -- \"double-intelligence\".  The logic with which you handle others and the logic with which you handle yourself, the logic with which you look at others and the logic with which you look at yourself. \n\nPlease listen, everyone understands everything is psycho-drama, everything is delusion, illusion, as long as it happens to others.\n\nThis lifestyle, thinking style of \"double-intelligence\"...... please understand, I don't want to use the word \"hypocrisy\" which is normally used.  I am using the word \"double-intelligence\", because in this double-intelligence both sides can be assimilated and become part of you.  If I use the word \"hypocrisy\", both sides have to be discarded.  See, you have two logic functioning.  If I use the word \"hypocrisy\", both have to be discarded.  But I am using the word \"double-intelligence\"; both have to be completed and assimilated.  The intelligence which you use to measure others, the intelligence which you use to measure yourself, both should be assimilated. Actually, both will be complementing each other.  Both will have different qualities which, when assimilated together, will make you a complete human-being. \n\nI can give you an example.  Whenever you are very angry, violent with others, you will have a deep guilt about yourself.  Whenever you have a deep love for yourself, you will have a deep hatred for others.  The qualities which complement, if digested by the Completion process, both will become strength for you.  That is why I am using the word \"double-intelligence\"; I am not using the word \"hypocrisy\".  Actually, what society, normal human-beings call as \"hypocrisy\", that is what I am calling as \"double-intelligence\".  But I don't want to use the word \"hypocrisy\".\n\nListen, understanding that everything is a psycho-drama, you become master of the outer world and you know how to create a psycho-drama for everybody and make them do what you want them to do.  But, when you understand that even what you are thinking about you and the way you are handling you is also a psycho-drama, you are an enlightened being!  You understanding what you are doing with yourself is also a psycho-drama is the first step to create a powerful space inside you.  The ability to create the right space inside you happens.  Please understand! Whenever you do not understand what is happening inside you also is a psycho-drama, even if you create a space for some reason inside you, you will not know the side-effects and after-effects of that space.  Whenever you leave a blind spot about the side-effects and after-effects of the space you create, the space you create gets destroyed, the space you create becomes more and more dangerous, the space you create does not get fulfilled; that is the ultimate effect. \n\nPlease understand, yesterday I was having a shooting for the Nithya Dharmam reality show, the last two days overtime schedule, every day we are shooting two-three episodes, because, you know that I'll be in Bali for almost the next twenty-five days. One nice thing is that these guys have managed this time in such a beautiful way, that I'll not be missing the satsangh even for a single day, even on the days when I'm traveling. The flights have been booked in such a way that I'll not be missing the satsangh even for a single day, when I'm going to Bali or coming back from Bali. Because I'll not be available in India for twenty-five days, we are continuously shooting.\n\nI could see, just not having a simple intelligence about life, the amount of suffering people cause to themselves!  What they cause to others is one, but the amount of suffering they cause to themselves is unimaginable!  Just because they can't tolerate one word, they are ready to give up their whole life's earnings and go and live somewhere in a small corner!  I am talking about the fight between husband and wife.  After fifty years of living together, just one word.....and this lady says, 'No!  I am going somewhere and living!'","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BDMz0XsoJDo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAfRm5Z_rcrL2l-vzC4UsEy4YvcCA","youtubeID":"BDMz0XsoJDo","viewCount":3580,"eventDate":"2013-11-26","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"does-your-life-have-blind-spots-bdmz0xsojdo"}}
