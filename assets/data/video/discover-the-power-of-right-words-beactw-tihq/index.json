When we take responsibility for the words we utter to ourselves and others, the tremendous power of words expresses through us. Once we change the thoughts of I can't to I can, then powerlessness, the feeling that something is impossible, and psychological disorders can be healed. Everything in life is possible when we carry the right words about ourselves and others!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, the Brahmotsava, Srivari Brahmotsava.  Venkateshwara is gracing us on Hamsa Vahana, Suvarna Hamsa Vahana -- the Golden Swan Vahana -- with all his grace and the Veena, he is gracing us on Suvarna  Vahana.  in Mohini Alankara.  He is in the incarnation in the form of Mohini.  To distribute the nectar to devathas he has taken this form.\n\nThe other side, Navaratri Utsava.  Devi is gracing us in the form of Meenakshi. Today, the day of Meenakshi's incarnation is celebrated.  In the form of Meenakshi she is gracing us with Lakshmi and Saraswathi serving her. \n\nGreat job of presenting Meenakshi in all her beauty and glory. Let us bow down to Meenakshi and Venkateshwara.\n\nAt the same time, two Brahmotsavas so beautifully both sides Devi and Vishnu are gracing.\n\nAnd  I think, by today or tomorrow, we will be starting the Chandi Homas. Oh today, today the Chandi Homas will be starting. From Kolkata we brought artists and made beautiful Durga deity which will be arriving.  You can have the darshan of the Durga may be today or tomorrow.  One side the Durga Puja also will start in the ashram. \n\nSo, the real festive season starts. The Navaratri Utsava starts. These nine days, meditate on the feminine energy in you.  The feminine energy in you should be beautifully awakened, inspired, encouraged. These nine days is the time for that. The Durga deity will be arriving in next two days.\n\nLet's enter into today's Nithya Satsangh. \n\nToday I wanted to expand about this Power of Words, the idea behind these words. \n\nPower of Words, please understand.\n\nAny impossibility you carry in your life is nothing but power of wrong words you utter to yourself and others, power of the wrong words you utter towards you and others. Any difficulty, any problem you experience in the life.\n\nLife flows with words. Please listen, for example, whenever you utter the words, \"It is not possible, not possible\", you take responsibility for that word.  Whenever you utter the word \"It is possible, it is possible\", you take responsibility for that word.  When you take responsibility for the right word, when you take responsibility for the right word and when you utter the right word, you discover the power of the right word.\n\nThe biggest problem in what I am saying, whatever I am saying, when you practice, when you try to practice, the biggest problem you will face is; you will utter the right words outside but you will not be uttering the same right words inside.  You will utter the right words outside but you will not be uttering the same words inside. Uttering the right words inside also and taking responsibility for it, please understand, taking responsibility for it that is a very important thing. Even when you decide in your feeling that you are going to take the responsibility for the words you uttered, for the words you are uttering, the Power of Words expresses through you. \n\nPower of Words. Please understand, single word can break relationship of ten or twenty years.   Single word can make the relationship which was not there for ten or twenty years. Single word can break the relationship of ten or twenty years. Single word can make the relationship which was not there for ten or twenty years.\n\nPower of the words. The words you utter, especially the words you utter towards you and the thinking you do. Please understand  we are all afraid of the Shani, Kethu, Rahu doshas which comes, may be, five years, six years, seven years, seven-and-a-half years, ten years; but we are not understanding  one of the biggest doshas with which we are suffering is Mamakara Dosha.  Means the very poor inner image, wrong or inadequate inner image with which we are suffering.  When you carry the wrong, inadequate inner image, everything of your life, what you think as taste even that comes from your inner image.  Please understand, what you think as taste of your life decides the quality of your life.  What you consider as the taste of your life, what you consider as the taste of your life.\n\nPlease understand, taste of your life makes you naturally think towards it. Taste of, what you consider as the taste of your life -   When I say \"taste\", I mean what you think as the result, goal, what you think you enjoy in your life; that makes you think you towards it, feel you towards it, utter words towards it.\n\nThe words you utter, the way you think, the way you feel, the way you live, everything is a power","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeAcTw-tIHQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAIrz-YzhO_qUbbsz-qIdEmE2vH8g","youtubeID":"BeAcTw-tIHQ","viewCount":3240,"eventDate":"2013-10-07","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"discover-the-power-of-right-words-beactw-tihq"}}
