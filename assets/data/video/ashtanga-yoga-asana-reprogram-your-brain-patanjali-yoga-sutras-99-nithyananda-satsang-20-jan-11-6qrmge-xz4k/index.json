It was the first online NSP. Many from around the world were sitting with Paramahamsa Nithyananda via teleconferencing, and in return, he was in many halls around the world, including: New York, Houston, Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, Columbus, Vancouver, Toronto, Singapore, Guadeloupe, Malaysia.\n\nSatsang means being in the company of the ultimate truth. Truth has a unique quality. When you are in the company of it , it makes you as it. Truth is a living happening. When you are in the company of the ultimate truth, Sat, it just fills you, you become that. Watching this broadcast, everyone was literally in the company of the ultimate truth- physically, mentally and verbally.\n\nTo prove this, Paramahamsa Nithyananda is conducting three experiments. The 1st experiment: to teleport vibhooti (sacred ash) to the padhukas (Paramahamsa Nithyananda's sandals) at each of the centers. The energized deity or padhuka is an independent intelligence. It responds to your prayers, emotions and thoughts independently and immediately. Paramahamsa Nithyananda was awakening the intelligence and independence of the padhukas.\n\nThe 2nd experiment:  materialize vibhooti in the hands of the people experiencing Kundalini awakening. His 3rd experiment will get vibhooti to materialize in the hands of non believers! It is actually not materializing, it is teleporting. Tomorrow when the vibhooti is teleporting, he promised to have a glass test tube here with the vibhooti, to prove that the vibhooti reduces where he is, and appears at the centres around the world.\n\nPatanjali explains how after conquering the pain and pleasures of the body you are no longer bound by it. In the last sutras Paramahamsa Nithyananda explained the theory of being steady and comfortable. In this discourse he gave the technique to make the body balanced. If you keep the body balanced you can go beyond pain and pleasure, and the intense, innate, inside pleasure gets awakened. When you are alive in your muscles, the pleasure created is so strong, so intense that you will go beyond outer pleasures.\n\nHe guided the audience into the correct posture, then aligned the nadi centres using bija (seed) mantras. It was an exhilarating way to begin the day.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6QRmge-xZ4k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBjlSbEuxOoNJKeGOETLrayndFsRQ","youtubeID":"6QRmge-xZ4k","viewCount":22331,"eventDate":"2011-01-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"11"},{"id":"16"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"ashtanga-yoga-asana-reprogram-your-brain-patanjali-yoga-sutras-99-nithyananda-satsang-20-jan-11-6qrmge-xz4k"}}
