The whole verse does not finger towards something. The greatness of these verses is it does not give us any visualization, concept or definition of God. Whenever ordinary human logic tries to define God, it gives birth to demoniac ideologies. His Holiness numerates the main ideologies – Daivik Tattva, the divine ideology; the demonic ideology and the human ideology. To understand the divine thought currents of this Upanishad, we need to first cognize these different ideologies.\n\n-  Daivik or Divine ideologies –where, those who practice them feel that others are reason for you to celebrate, and others feel that you are reason for them to celebrate.\n\n-        Human ideologies – are where people who practice they feel good but not others, they can be manipulated, misused, used like a weapon.\n\n-       Demonic ideologies are – eliminating, excluding others. First they kill all the who oppose, then they start killing who don’t oppose, and those whom they don’t accept.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda takes us then to the – understanding of Shreyas and Preyas, the good and the pleasant.  Those who had the Daivik tattvas became inactive, leading to allow the bad ideologies to be rampant. Good people are giving up ambitiousness, bad people are highly ambitious. The Katha Upanishad give us the truth of choosing the GOOD (shreyas) over the PLEASANT (Preyas). Those who choose good succeed in the strategy of life. Always choose people who make you more and more integrated, responsible, more powerful to your core.\n\nHe beautifully defines the pure meaning of DHIRAH - Dhirah is the person who has the ability to put the right understanding in the brain and conquer himself. VIRAH is the external management, DHIRAH is micro management of the being.\n\nThe subject for spiritual explorations or discussions, vaakyartha Sadas is – good and pleasant, what are we choosing in our life everyday, Shreyah or Preyah?\n\nKena Upanishad, verse 2 – Pure Questioning\nśrotrasya śrotraṁ manaso mano yad  vāco ha vācaṁ sa u prāṇasya prāṇaḥ |\ncakṣuṣaś-cakṣur-atimucya dhīrāḥ  pretyāsmāllokād-amṛtā bhavanti || 2 ||\nIt is the Ear of the ears, the Mind of the mind, the Speech of the speech. It indeed is the Vital Life of the life energy, and It also is the Eye of the eyes. The wise, enlightened beings, having liberated themselves on leaving and rising beyond this ephemeral world, become immortal, eternal [amṛta bhavanti].","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jNj5MdZ_PL4/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"jNj5MdZ_PL4","viewCount":4885,"eventDate":"2016-08-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"what-will-you-choose-good-or-pleasant-jnj5mdzpl4"}}
