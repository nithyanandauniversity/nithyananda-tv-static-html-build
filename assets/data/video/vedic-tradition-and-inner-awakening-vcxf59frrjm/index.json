We have the choice to declare how we want to live by the words we express in our inner space. When we establish powerful words inside, it manifests outside in the positive declarations we make. We can use the power of thinking by aligning ourselves with how we view ourselves inside, how we project ourselves to others, and how others perceive us. We can decide that everything in life is joyful and that nothing can make us powerless!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n\nAnnouncement by Ma Maneesha:  We are very delighted to announce a very special event happening in the Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam, Bangalore, Bidadi ashram.  Today we have amidst us the Akhila Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, which is conducting a Workshop on creating awareness and protecting Hinduism and Bharat.  This event is happening in the Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam Ashram, Bidadi, today and tomorrow.  The organizers of the Akhila Bharat Hindu Mahasabha are here to invite Pujya Swamiji, Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda, for the event.  The Akhila Bharat Hindu Mahasabha was founded in 1882 by freedom fighter, Veer Savarkar.\n\nSwamis from various sampradayas , national leaders, state leaders, and writers, are amongst the various  who are attending this workshop which is to support the cause of Hinduism and uplifting of Bharat.\n\nWe also take this opportunity to extend our humble invitation to Shri Shri Pranavananda Swamiji, the Working President of the Karnataka Akhila Bharat Mahasabha, and Shri Basavaraja Swamiji, Pontiff of the Basava Mandapa Ashram, Bagalkot, and Head of the Rashtriya Basava Dal.\n\nSwamiji starts the satsangh:\n\nI am very happy to invite Hindu Mahasabha organizers and two prominent Hindu saints from Karnataka, Shri Shri Pranavananda Swamiji and Shri Basavaraja Swamiji.  Thank you for coming.  And we are very happy to host the Hindu Mahasabha two day event, their conference in  Bidadi campus.  Today and tomorrow, the Hindu Mahasabha is conducting their program on creating awareness and protecting Bharat and Hinduism.  The Hindu Mahasabha is an organization started in thousand eight hundred and eighty two by freedom fighter Veer Savarkar.  And I am very happy to host the event.  Both the Swamis are here to conduct their program and workshop which will be starting around 10:30   so I request everyone to attend and be inspired and join the whole event.\n\nI really wanted to share one information.  Chakrapani Maharaj, Head of the Hindu Mahasabha, has stood by us and strongly supported us from the beginning throughout our thin and thick times.  We have relationship with Chakrapani Maharaj at least for the last seven to eight years.  We know him and he knows us, and he is with us throughout.  This moment, I wanted to take this moment to thank Chakrapani Maharaj of Hindu Mahasabha for support he gave us and all the support we received from him.\n\nThe first false allegation put on our Gurukul - 'The kids are forced and given Sannyas. ' I wanted to make sure very clearly, they are neither forced nor given Sannyas.  Be very clear, they are given only something called \"Krama Brahmacharya\".  It means, in Indian tradition, anybody who wants to study till their marriage has to take up Brahmacharya Vrata.  Anybody who wants to study, whether you want to study archery, agriculture, or business, Vedas, Upanishads, or Vaastu Shaastra, or astrology, anything you want to study, you have to take the Brahmacharya Vrata, wear Yajnopavitha andpractice certain vows for learning purpose. For the purpose of learning, you need to practice certain methods to concentrate yourself.  So it is called Krama Brahmacharya.  So my kids are given only Krama Brahmacharya and when they become eighteen, when they complete their education, they can get married. There is no such thing as they cannot get married.  Be very clear, I am making it very clear, once they complete their education -- usually in Indian tradition, kids complete their education, the basic education, by eighteen and the advanced education by twenty-five -- so when they complete their education, they can drop this Krama Brahmacharya and they can get married and enter the regular householder life.  So, they are neither forced nor given sannyas.  This the first thing I wanted  to make it very clear.  \n\nThe second false allegation made - ' I am making crores and crores of money by running this gurukul. ' They need to know the gurukul is done as a service project, as a service project. Parents do contribute, but voluntarily. There's a clear standing policy. No kid will be denied because of no money. Many kids get  sponsored or fully-sponsored scholarship.  Sixty percent of the students in our gurukul are given partial or full sponsorship for their studies. We are not running this as a business.  We are running it as a charity.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vcXf59fRRJM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLB4PDnBRQ513iu25lcSs2aeWImcug","youtubeID":"vcXf59fRRJM","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"vedic-tradition-and-inner-awakening-vcxf59frrjm"}}
