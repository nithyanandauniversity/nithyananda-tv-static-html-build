These three alone keep us from expanding and having success in life. Advaita Vedanta is the only religion that teaches us the science of completion, giving us the exact tools needed, not only to excel in life, but to allow enlightenment to flow in us!\nTRANSCRIPTION:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings. And when I say 'I welcome all of you', I mean here....some enthusiasts at Haridwar. No I am answering him only. When I say, 'I welcome all of you', I mean here. It's OK go ahead with the fiasco.\n\nBut over enthusiasm is always good then being dead. It's OK. Hinduism needs overdose of enthusiasm actually because we are 200 dose of enthusiasm and excitement. Even in teaching style we are the only religion who have the style of sitting and go on speaking. I tried; at least I'll change that style. Standing and teaching or walking and teaching but somehow Hindus are not able to accept because almost all teachers or preachers are with a big belly - that is why big cushions, to hide the belly only cushions and nice bed kind of a seat and you don't know whether they are sitting or lying down. And covered in the front also with a table! Somehow if you stand and talk or walk and talk it doesn't feel like a Hindu way. Anyhow, what to do? Hinduism needs enthusiasm. Come on.\n\nToday, I will expand on Kalpataru.  \n\nSome of the important things you need to understand in life is -- I wanted to insist on this truth again and again even if you have heard it from me earlier -- everything, every suffering you have in your life, even not getting what you want in the life, everything boils down only to one thing: your Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial - SDHD.  It is the SDHD only demon in the life.  Somehow, so strongly you believe that you cannot get it.  Your intellect says you cannot get it.  Your emotion says you should not get it.  Your life says you did not get it.  No, really I am telling you, after the Shivaratri. See, till coming Shivaratri, \"Shravana Rithu\" -- Listening, Listening, Listening; after Shivaratri till Guru Purnima, \"Completion with SDHD Rithu\".  The Sanskrit we'll phrase it; maybe we will come up with a new word -- \"Poornathwa Rithu\".  Please understand, once you complete with SDHD, you don't need any spiritual practice.  If you don't complete with SDHD, no spiritual practice will work on you.  \n\nSee, in a deep part of our being, the Self-Doubt, Self-Hatred, Self-Denial has gone so deep, you strongly believe no spiritual practice will work for you.  I have a big group, I know.  They are all so clear, 'My Kundalini will not be moved.  I will not have any experience.  Whatever Swamiji says I will believe, I'll try to practice, but no spiritual practice can transform me.'  They are very clear.  Please understand, sometimes the transformation means even you entering into a zone where you don't know what is going to happen to you.  That is what you are afraid of.  You can't handle.  You become too compassionate than you wanted because, when the transformation comes, there is no limit.  It is not going to be limited.  Transformation is not Private Limited.  No, really I am telling you. ..... It is now going to work.\n\nFirst I launched Mahamantra Meditation.  Then Seven Chakras Meditation.  Then Seven Koshas Meditation.  Then Pancha Kosha Meditation.  Then Unclutching, the great contribution.  Then comes the Science of Completion.  Then comes Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching.  Now comes SDHD, completion with SDHD.  No, how many ever new things I may go on inventing, you will have a clear, 'No, whatever Swamiji says works for others; it works. For me ahh, for me nothing works.  I don't know what to do.'  Understand, the bad news is, with SDHD no spiritual practice will work for you.  The good news is, SDHD can be completed.  Understand the bad news is: no spiritual practice, whether you try to complete, or unclutch, or...No spiritual practice will work for you, because you have a strong belief.  The bad news is, with SDHD no spiritual practice will work.  The good news is, SDHD itself can be completed, please understand you can really, really complete SDHD.\n\nFrom Shivaratri to Guru Purnima, \"Rithu of Completion\", Season of Completion with SDHD.  But, that does not mean you need to wait till Shivaratri.  Start now!  I tell you, a person who has completed with SDHD is a most graceful and handsome, beautiful being.  What is \"grace\"?  See, \"beauty\" is when you see from distance how skin looks -- the shape of the body and the skin -- that is \"beauty\".  \"Grace\" is, when you spend time with that person, when you are around that person, what is the material out of which that person is made, what is the principles out of which he is made, what is he radiating, what is he believing as himself and","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JdmO1XV6PUU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLB4nzHe8QvjSqsgumm6U2QI-NLIMQ","youtubeID":"JdmO1XV6PUU","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"what-is-stopping-your-success-jdmo1xv6puu"}}
