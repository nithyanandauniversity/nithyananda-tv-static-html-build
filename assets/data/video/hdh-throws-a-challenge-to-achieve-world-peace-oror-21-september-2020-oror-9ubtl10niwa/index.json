THE MOMENT DVANDVA COMES TO EXIST, THE FEAR OR GREED BECOMES THE COGNISED REALITY.\n\n*NEVER ALLOW THE DVANDA, DVAITA AS COGNISED REALITY EVEN IF IT IS OBJECTIVE REALITY BECAUSE COGNISED REALITY IS THE DECISION MAKER, GAME CHANGER ABOUT YOUR OBJECTIVE REALITY.\n\n*THERE ARE 3 REALITIES: OBJECTIVE, SUBJECTIVE, COGNISED.\n\n*THE COGNISED REALITY CHANGES THE QUALITY, QUANTITY, DEFINITION, PERCEPTION, EXPERIENCE OF SUBJECTIVE REALITY THAT CHANGES THE OBJECTIVE REALITY PERCEIVED BY US.\n\n*COGNISED REALITY IS THE ONLY ZONE WHERE YOU CAN WORK CONSCIOUSLY; ALTER THE COGNITION.\n\n*UNFORTUNATELY, INSTEAD OF WORKING ON THE COGNISED REALITY, YOU GO ON WORKING ON THE OBJECTIVE REALITY.\n\n*THE IDEAS WHICH MAKES YOU WORK ON OBJECTIVE REALITY SHOWING OBJECTIVE REALITY IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY IS WHAT I CALL PIOUS FRAUD. IT MAKES YOU FEEL OBJECTIVE REALITY IS TOO IMPORTANT, TOO REAL AND NEEDS TO BE ATTENDED IMMEDIATELY.\n\n*ANYTHING WHICH IS TOLD TO YOU IN A LOVING CARING WAY FOR YOUR INTEREST, ONLY THEN YOU START LISTENING.\n\n*SO MAYA ENTERS INTO YOU IN A VERY PIOUS WAY CONVINCING YOU IT IS FOR YOUR GOOD SHE IS DOING WHAT SHE IS DOING.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT I CALL PIOUS FRAUD.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE REALITY MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS FOR YOUR GOOD YOU ARE ASKED TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISION, LIVE A CERTAIN WAY AND MAKE TO MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS. O GOD! SONS OF DEVILS -\nTHE SO CALLED CHAOS INSTIGATORS OF SOCIETY.\n\n*TODAY IS INTERNATIONAL PEACE DAY. WHOEVER INSPIRES THE REAL PEACE BRINGS LIBERATION AND ALL THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD TO YOU.\nRead More At : https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4385510201536796?__tn__=K-R","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9UBTL10niWA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"9UBTL10niWA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"hdh-throws-a-challenge-to-achieve-world-peace-oror-21-september-2020-oror-9ubtl10niwa"}}
