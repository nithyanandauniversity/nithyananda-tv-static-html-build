As per the Vedic calendar, Ramakrishna’s birthday! Ramakrishna was born on the second thithi of Amavasya. So, this time, Amavasya came next to Shivaratri Day. That is the reason; today Ramakrishna’s birthday is celebrated. \nAnd today is also a very important day in our movement, in our Sangha – Jeevan Mukthi Jayanthi! So today we will be celebrating the great book which is born, released today – “Jeevan Mukthi” – which naturally gets updated because I am alive and I am updating myself; “Jeevan Mukthi” book also gets updated. It is a powerful book, still one of the best books I have written. We are working on coming up with more and more volumes of “Jeevan Mukthi”. And, on this great day, auspicious day, fortunately today, Ramakrishna’s birthday and Jeevan Mukthi Jayanthi falling together! But actually, Ramakrishna’s birthday is observed as per the Vedic calendar; Jeevan Mukthi Jayanthi we observe as per the English calendar. \nToday, fortunately, both coincided on the same day. Anyhow, let us take this opportunity to revive our commitment to Integrity. Please understand, if I have to condense the whole life of Sri Ramakrishna, the essence of Ramakrishna’s life, I’ll condense it in one word; that is: “Commitment to Integrity”. He is such an embodiment of Integrity, embodiment of Integrity, I tell you, just embodiment of Integrity! The words he gives, he will be so honest, respectful and honour the word he gives. I have never read or heard any master who has this high degree of integrity like Sri Ramakrishna. I am not saying other masters are not integrated, but the degree, the frequency of integrity is too high with Sri Ramakrishna. That is why he had such a powerful Vaak Siddhi. Even though he will not demonstrate many times, he had a powerful Vaak Siddhi. That is why his words, ordinary village slang, colloquial words uttered by him are translated today in almost all the world languages, read by crores of people, guiding thousands of Sannyasis. \nI tell you, in the modern history of Hinduism, he is the Master, incarnation, who created, inspired, initiated largest number of Sannyasis. This I can tell boldly, very boldly with all my integrity. Neither Bhagawan Swaminarayan nor Arya Samaj Dayananda Saraswathi, none of them can cross the contribution of Sri Ramakrishna, the number of Sannyasis he created, inspired, initiated and still continues to inspire. Incomparable. So, understand, his contribution, hardly in last 150 years in 1886 he left the body. In 1836 he assumed the body; in 1886 he left the body. Just fifty years he lived on Planet Earth in the physical form. 150 years hardly but unimaginable contribution!\nApart from the sadhus and sannyasis of Ramakrishna Order, thousands of people have renounced their life in the name of Ramakrishna and live in their own places. He is the inspiration who can’t be compared. For thousands of people, he is the spiritual strength.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRDIUnyokVg/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"sRDIUnyokVg","viewCount":2922,"eventDate":"2014-03-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"rewrite-your-future-attend-inner-awakening-srdiunyokvg"}}
