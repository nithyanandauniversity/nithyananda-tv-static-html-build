People from all over the world have descended on the ashram for 21 days of intense process with the master.\nContinuing on Siddha tradition topic, today he explained God Consciousness.  On the chart he has created with the five states of consciousness according to the Siddha Tradition.\nThese five states overlap each other to create a total of 25 states.  Of these, five are what he calls God Consciousness, the states experienced by Enlightened Beings. They are:\nConscious Waking -- no thought state -- see what is, but reside in Nirvikalpi state.\nConscious Dreaming -- aware of any dreams passing through consciousness, simply witness them, but stay aware\nConscious Sleeping -- rest in awareness without dreaming or sleeping and awaken refreshed.\nConscious Awareness -- can experience this sitting in the Master's presence, you are conscious of pure awareness -- this is Upanishad.\nConscious Consciousness -- merging with the master -- there is no definition or scale to judge this.\nBy being aware of these states, you will be able to find a true guru to follow.  If you experience any of these states when with a master, he is authentic. If, instead, you experience troubled, heavy sleep, you are with a psychic or a dark arts practitioner.  If, upon awaking from sleep, the world has more depth, deeper colors, more awareness, you have received energy darshan from an enlightened master, and should follow this one.\nThese states are experienced by someone completely established in enlightenment. Whatever they do, they radiate God.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
