In this clip taken from Patanjali Yoga Sutras discourse 11 (Sutra 14), Swamiji sheds more light on the deeper secrets about body and mind.  Swamiji describes his very own experience of the process of psychological death where He used this very technique of Patanjali for enlightenment.  When he sat at Manikarnika Ghat with resve to sit there forever, the power which was resisting lost hold on His consciousness.  That very moment the mind came back to the present moment.  Your idea about the future plays a major role in your present actions.  Swamiji then teaches us that the idea you have of your body and mind is either your best friend or your worst enemy.  Happiness, joy, bliss are nothing but the ideas we have of our mind and body.
