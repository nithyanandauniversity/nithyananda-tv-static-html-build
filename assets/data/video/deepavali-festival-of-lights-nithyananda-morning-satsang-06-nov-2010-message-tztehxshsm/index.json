It is not only one of India's most important celebrations, but this day commemorates Paramahamsa Nithyananda's first blessings given in Tamil after his enlightenment settled into his body.  It was on Deepavali in the year 2000 that he came out of his 9 months of silence and uttered his first words as an Enlightened Master and Avatar, \"Be Blissful\".\nHis message to us all was to understand the true meaning of Deepah, the lamp of knowledge.  It is a mystical message which reminds us to see beyond the seen.  All of our suffering comes from only seeing what is seen, which is based on our internal expectations. \nWhen we are stuck in what is seen, we create suffocation for ourselves. He reminds us to go beyond the seen, go beyond his image, to nirvikalpi. This creates breathing space within us.  By seeing beyond what is seen, we will have dancing space, and extraordinary ecstasy. \nSo often he sees people only picking what they want to see, not what he is offering.  To be around him, it is important to be blissful and happy.  Even one wound in your system, one samskara, will keep you missing him, abusing him. This creates a big problem for him. People need to break out of these flawed mental setups, and Deepavali is the day when new resolutions can be made and kept.\nEven Paramahamsa Nithyananda did this in Varanasi yesterday.  To commemorate Deepavali while he was there he wanted to keep up the tradition and drop something. Even though he dropped everything when he became enlightened, he thought, \"I'll drop something again.\"\nHe decided to drop any hurt to him that might have been caused by society, people, ex-disciples, or nature, which he doesn't know about.  In return, he asked all of his disciples around the world to drop any hurt they feel he might have caused them.  As we are unaware of how Existence works through him, or the reason behind his actions, don't feel hurt when he does something that is necessary for our growth, or because we have misinterpreted something based on our own samskaras.\nIt is a time for us all to heal.  The best way of doing this is to continue doing heavy Hatha Yoga every day.  He reminded us that in the siddha tradition, every day devotees must do 700 pranayams in the morning, 200 at noon, and 200 in the evening, to prepare our bodies to hold the Kundalini explosion that will happen.  Currently the ashramites are doing 108 Sun Salutations (surya namaskars) every morning. One sun salutation equals 12 pranayams, so following the ashramite routine will prepare your body for the Kundalini awakening and hold it. Beginning tomorrow he will be speaking on the Siddha tradition for the next month.\nHappy Deepavali!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tz_teHxsHsM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCi27WHsWxbVXhOAJawtnbyV9qpaQ","youtubeID":"tz_teHxsHsM","viewCount":3776,"eventDate":"2010-11-12","duration":1686,"likeCount":74,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"11"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"deepavali-festival-of-lights-nithyananda-morning-satsang-06-nov-2010-message-tztehxshsm"}}
