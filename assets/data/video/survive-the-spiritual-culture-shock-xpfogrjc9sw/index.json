The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 23, Paramahamsa Nithyananda unveils the first step to deepening our awareness and open us to liberation. Our basic bio-memory is programmed to respond to life at the lowest level of fear and greed. We can purify this programming through repeated study of the great spiritual truths. Even when we fall short, we continue to soak ourselves in the teachings until they completely replace our bio-memory. Then our bodies become clean vehicles through which we can vibrate to a higher frequency.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday in Bhagavad Gita 4th chapter Jnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga, 23rd verse -\n\n\"gata-sangasya muktasya jnanaavasthita-chetasah |\nyajnaayaacharatah karma samagram pravileeyate ||\"\n\nThe duties that are performed as an act of adoration by the one in whom attachment has ceased, who is relaxed and whose reasoning faculty is settled in consciousness, completely dissolve, bear no binding result.\"\n\nThree technical terms you need to understand in this verse -- Gata sangasya muktasya -- unattached to the modes of the material nature. Means, see the material nature is to drive you with the fear or greed. It is very nature of the matter you are carrying, not just the matter of the nature which is driving you. Because you are carrying the body, you can be driven only by fear and greed. It is not just the driver's mistake, it is the vehicle's mistake also. Your vehicle, your body itself is a matter of driving force. Just two days before I was discussing with some of our Ashramites about this administration rules. That time, I was sharing an important insight which I wanted to share with all of you, now.\n\nBy the nature of the bio memory, human beings need to be feeling certain level of fear and greed. If you don't even provide that much of material for them to be afraid of something and to be greedy of something, they will feel so empty inside, they will create unnecessarily phobias - height of fear, suddenly something will happen.. The unnecessary, reasonless, causeless phobias settle in your system if enough fear and greed is not supplied to your basic bio memory. By your nature, just because you are carrying a human body which is programmed with fear and greed, certain amount of fear and greed is required even to drive you. That becomes survival necessity. The administration is supposed to take care you don't create the fear and greed in everybody the same level. No. There are some people, a little bit of fear and greed is enough, they will be full, they will run, start driving. There are some people, may be more fear & greed is required for them to run. Some people who need more fear & greed, if you give them less fear & greed, they are in danger. Now, they will start creating unnecessary phobias. Please understand, many of your unnecessary phobias are created when you try to protect yourself from the basic amount of fear and greed which is required to run your life. I have seen many people, they try to protect themselves from the basic fear and greed which is needed to run their life, without purifying their bio memory. If you purify your bio memory by actions -- karma and evolve, then move out of fear and greed, nothing wrong - you will be liberated! But without making your bio memory mature, if you try to move out of fear and greed, I can give you this one example, people who leave everything and go for parivraajaka, yaatra, aghori life style, naagaas - without maturing your bio memory, if you leave everything and go, the small, small phobias -- phobia of cockroach, phobia of scorpion, phobia of  snake -- small, small fears will take over your inner space, you will develop unneccesary phobias. I have seen there was a sadhu who had phobia about rivers. See, if you go near a river and have a fear that suddenly a flood may come and I may be flooded, that is ok. He will not even go on a bridge, well-built bridge where buses and trains can go. No. Forget about going on a bridge, he will not even see the river from the distance. How many phobias are there! God! When I read the list, I got the phobia of phobias! Phobias are pseudo fear, perverted fear. Like how pornography is perverted lust, phobias are perverted fears. Never pornography lust can be transformed because it is perverted, it is impossible to transform it nor the phobias can be cleared because it is perverted, impossible to clear, almost.\n\nOf course, only working on your non-mechanical parts of the brain and the inner space, you can be free of this. By the mode of the material nature, you are driven by fear and greed.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XPFOgrjc9Sw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA_tlTyKRIu6fg1CcqiFgJvwtcAxQ","youtubeID":"XPFOgrjc9Sw","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"survive-the-spiritual-culture-shock-xpfogrjc9sw"}}
