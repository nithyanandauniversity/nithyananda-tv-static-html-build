IT IS A TOO IMPORTANT SATSANG TODAY.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM SHRIKAILASA:\n\nCONSCIOUSLY MANIFEST THE FUTURE BY PLANTING YOUR CONSCIOUS SANKALPA, DECISION, YOUR CONSCIOUS WILL, BY RENOUNCING THE SELF-DOUBT, SELF-HATRED, SELF-DENIAL (SDHD). THEN YOU WILL MANIFEST YOUR FUTURE AS YOU WANT.\n\n*FIRST STEP: RENOUNCE SDHD; TYAGA - SACRIFICE THROUGH RENOUNCING. IT IS BY RENOUNCING THE DREAM THAT YOU RAISE TO JAGRAT (WAKING STATE), IT IS BY RENOUNCING THE WAKING STATE THAT YOU RAISE TO TURIYA (HIGHER FOURTH STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS).\n\n\n*ONLY BY RENOUNCING THIS WHOLE DELUSION OF SELF DOUBT, SELF HATRED AND SELF DENIAL, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO YOUR FUTURE. WHENEVER YOU EVEN THINK OF PLANNING YOUR FUTURE, YOU WILL SEE SO MUCH OF PAIN OF ‘MANY TIMES I PLANNED BUT FAILED’. ALL YOUR PLANS ARE ‘STITCHING OF UNCONSCIOUS VAGUE THOUGHTS’. I WILL TEACH YOU THE ‘CONSCIOUS FUTURE MANIFESTATION’ NOW.\n\n\n*TAKE THE CALENDAR OF 2020. IF IT IS ON PRINTED PAPER, GREAT. IF NOT, SEE IT ATLEAST ON YOUR LAPTOP SCREEN. IT IS A VERY POWERFUL PROCESS I AM GOING TO GUIDE YOU INTO. JUST SEE ALL THE MONTHS THAT ARE GOING TO COME. MARK WHAT YOU WANT TO MANIFEST - ON THE DATE YOU WANT. YOU WILL SEE HOW MUCH OF PAIN, DOUBT, HATRED COMING INSIDE YOU WHEN YOU WRITE IT. BUT NEVER EVER YOU PLANNED CONSCIOUSLY.  IT WAS ALWAYS BEATEN BY UNCONSCIOUS SDHD.\n\n\n*TO ALL MY DISCIPLES, I AM GIVING YOU THE BOON: WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING NOW I AM GOING TO MAKE INTO REALITY! MY POWERS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN YOUR SDHD. DROP YOUR SDHD, PAINS, UNCONSCIOUS VAGUE THINKING, INCLUDING “EVEN AFTER SWAMIJI BLESSING, I DID NOT MANIFEST”.\n\n\n*FOR EXAMPLE: YOU WANT TO HAVE DOUBLE THE SALARY YOU ARE HAVING NOW BY SEPTEMBER, MARK THAT; YOU WANT TO MAKE MILLION DOLLARS BY MARCH, MARK THAT; YOU WANT TO MARRY THIS PERSON BY JUNE, MARK THAT; YOU WANT TO HAVE A NEW HOUSE BY THIS MONTH, MARK THAT; YOU WANT A SIX PACK BODY THROUGH GYM-EXERCISING, MARK THAT. WHEN YOU ARE MARKING, SEE HOW MUCH PAIN, ANGER, FRUSTRATION, DOUBT, IMPOSSIBILITY, VIOLENCE IS FLOWING IN YOU. BE CLEAR, YOU NEVER TRUSTED YOUR LIFE OR YOUR ABILITY TO MANIFEST, OR YOUR FUTURE POSSIBILITY. YOUR WHOLE INNER SPACE’S THINKING WAS FILLED BY EXTREME DELUSION, ANGER, FRUSTRATION, AND IMPOSSIBILITY. YOU WILL START FROM THE TIME YOU WERE A BABY AND YOU TOOK THE FIRST STEP, HOW YOU FELL DOWN, AND YOU WILL CONVINCE YOURSELF ON WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND WHY WASTE TIME ON GYM MEMBERSHIP.\n\n\n*DEATH HAPPENS WHEN YOU STOP BREATHING. DEATH STARTS WHEN YOU STOP TRYING.\n\n\n*PARAMASHIVA SAYS, “PEOPLE DON’T MANIFEST THEIR FUTURE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH ANGER ABOUT PAST FAILURE, CURSING LIFE BECAUSE OF THEIR IMAGINED IMPOSSIBILITY.” WHEN YOU SIT AND PEN DOWN YOUR 12-MONTH CALENDAR, YOU WILL SEE HOW MUCH YOU FLARE UP WITH THESE THINGS. STOP REACTING WHEN YOU ARE AGITATED. STOP FLARING UP WHEN YOU ARE FEELING IMPOSSIBLE. STOP RESPONDING TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY.\n\n\n*HIGHEST RENUNCIATION - GREATEST TYAGA - IS RENOUNCING YOUR SELF-HATRED. PARAMASHIVA IS WORSHIPPED IN INDRA LOKA AS ‘TYAGARAJA’. I WAS WONDERING, PARAMASHIVA WORSHIPPED IN SWARGA LOKA SHOULD BE KNOWN AS RAJA OF PLEASURE; WHY IS HE CALLED TYAGARAJA?\n\n\n*WHEN MUSUKUNDA CHAKRAVARTI WENT TO SWARGA LOKA... (UNDERSTAND: WE HINDUS USED TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PLANES, AND IT USED TO AND IS STILL A LIFESTYLE FOR US. THE HINDU PRACTICES BEING CALLED AS SUPERSTITIOUS IN INDIA IS THE FUNNIEST THING!) ANYWAY, HE HELPED DEVATAS IN THE WAR WITH RAKSHASAS. BECAUSE HE HELPED AND THEY WON THE WAR, THE HEAD OF THE DEVATAS, INDRA, WANTED TO GIFT HIM SOMETHING BECAUSE OF HELPING IN THE WAR. HE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTS. MUSUKUNDA CHAKRAVATI SAID, “MY CHOLA KINGDOM IS MUCH MORE AMAZING THAN YOUR SWARGA. I LOOKED AROUND SWARGA, THERE IS NOTHING WHICH IS NOT THERE IN THE CHOLA KINGDOM.” INDRA WAS VERY ASHAMED. HE INSISTED, “PLEASE ASK FOR SOMETHING. I HAVE TO KEEP MY PRIDE. I WON THE WAR BECAUSE OF YOUR SUPPORT. IT WILL GIVE ME THE FEELING OF FULFILLMENT OF HAVING SHOWN MY GRATITUDE.” MUSUKUNDA CHAKRAVARTI SAID, “ONE THING I LIKED IN YOUR INDRA LOKA: THE BEAUTIFUL DEITY OF PARAMASHIVA YOU ARE WORSHIPPING! IN TIRUVARUR, WE HAVE A GREAT TEMPLE BUT OUR MAIN DEITY IN TIRUVARUR IS A SWAYAMBHU MURTI.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LEODc8Tirs/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"1LEODc8Tirs","viewCount":18218,"eventDate":"2020-01-04","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"manifest-your-desires-by-dropping-self-doubt-self-hatred-and-self-denial-sdhd-1leodc8tirs"}}
