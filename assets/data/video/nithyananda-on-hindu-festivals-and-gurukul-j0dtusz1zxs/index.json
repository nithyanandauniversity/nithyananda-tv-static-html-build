This is the only place in the whole world where kids get a complete education; learning to become both scientists and saints! Watch out for the next wave of Incarnations to walk planet Earth!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday is the eighth year anniversary of Gurukul, Nithyananda Gurukul.  Nithyananda Gurukul is completing successfully seven years and entering into the eighth year.  In 2006, on the same Vijaya Dashami day, the Gurukul started.\n\nThe Gurukul’s achievements:\n\nI can just list the amazing intelligence, clarity the gurukul kids are expressing. Even doctors are shocked and surprised. They don’t know how to measure this now. They don’t have a scale to measure the intelligence and the IQ level of our gurukul kids! Four doctors I put them on this job, they say, swamiji we have to develop some new scale. All available scales do not even match with the intelligence of our gurukul kids. All these IQ, EQ and all, they blow it away!  How they learn across multiple dimensions along with studies of international IGCSE syllabus! They learn dance, drama, theater, music (vocal, instruments like taval, keyboard, nadaswaram, flute etc.), drawing, painting, pottery, magic, department administration, vedic chanting, temple arts (puja, homa), Yoga, mallakhamba yoga, rope yoga, audio-visual management, web designing, web development, knitting, clay modeling, crochet, magazines, energy bead, comic books  conducting online satsanghs as teachers for other children, family counseling, mentoring adults, swimming, tv shows…….! \n\nAnd, I wanted you to know, the first ever Talk Show hosted by kids on the Planet Earth is hosted by our gurukul kids! In other tv’s kids compere, nowhere kids take questions from the viewers.  And first ever Talk Show where kids answer, inspire more kids to join the Gurukul or understand these whole principles what we are teaching. It is just unimaginable! You all need to know, just by conducting the Talk Show – the Talk Show is conducted in Lotus News Channel – where the kids are giving counseling to other kids online on Skype, two-way video-conferencing, they listen to the troubles kids across the globe and counsel, them and give solutions. Not only conducting, taking phone calls in enriching temple. When the kids run the show, the phone calls in the Enriching Temple are attended by the kids and they answer! \n\nWith this, now, we reached out the Nithyananda Bala Vidyalaya, teaching the kids to harness the Power of Words, Power of Thinking, Power of Feeling and Power of Living; the four-principles-based syllabus, that is what I call Nithyananda Bala Vidyalaya. This education is offered freely. They have reached out to 32,000 kids! Now 32,000 kids are enrolled. 45 schools, 30 Homes, 59 centers in 12 countries, our gurukul kids are teaching! Understand, this syllabus which is being followed, books are released already in seven languages – English, Tamil, Hindi, Slovak, Traditional Chinese, Simple Chinese and Spanish. In seven languages books are available. Here I am releasing the books for all of you. These are all the primary school books,Textbooks and workbooks for Class 1 to 5 – English, Science, History, Geography. Please understand the amount of reach in seven years is not a joke! It is all done by kids directly!  Adults do a little help, but the major work is done by the kids. And this binding (of the books), don’t think it is done urgently or a mistake; it is consciously designed this way. I am further developing the designing on palm leaves. Soon the books will be available like bigger palm leaves. The kids will have the exact feel of traditional gurukul. I am also already working on if the printing can be done on palm leaf, so that the books can be made available in the palm leaf form itself for the kids to study, especially the traditional scriptures.\n\nEND OF SATSANG:-\nActually, you may have twenty-one initiations, not twenty-three exactly, because a few days we will be travelling to different places, different temples, having different rituals, celebrations, Completion sessions. Don’t miss it! Or, I can say positively, be part of it! May be I have to take a few more days to continue to introduce the Inner Awakening Level-4. \n\nSomebody told me yesterday, ‘Swamiji, whenever we think you cannot take us further in spirituality, this is the peak, this is the depth, suddenly a door opens!  How is it?”\n\nActually, that is the way spirituality itself is! In spirituality always, the moment you feel you reached the peak, suddenly a new door opens, you move to the next level! So, please understand, even if you are at the peak of Everest now, don’t miss the chance of getting into the flight! Inner Awakening Level-3 is like peak of Everest. Level-4 is getting into the flight! Don’t miss this experience! Be part of it!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0dTUsZ1zxs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBK79GfPTc9iPXDiNxJcHqIybeQ8w","youtubeID":"j0dTUsZ1zxs","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"nithyananda-on-hindu-festivals-and-gurukul-j0dtusz1zxs"}}
