How we express ourselves, in either joy or sadness, should be unique to us, not dictated by media or society. Let us realize the power that our words, thinking, and feelings have on our lives and use them to live to our peak possibility!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I wanted to expand on some of these principles in depth. This Power of Words, what it can cause in you, Power of Thinking, Power of Feeling, Power of Living. I think more than the word 'Power of Living', I may use the word 'Powers of Living', because living is not words plus feelings plus thinking. Please listen. Life is not equalent to words plus thinking plus feeling; it is something more than all these put together. See, life is not something equalent to your body plus mind. There is something more. That component which is something more is still not defined and can't be explained. I can say, that is the grey area.\n\nUnderstand step by step the Power of Words. Words you utter can either make your life or break your life.  Words others utter towards you can make your life or break your life. And the words others utter towards you is not accident; the words you utter towards others is responsible for the words others throw towards you. Please listen, the words you throw at your servant, you will receive it from your boss.  The words you throw at your neighbors, you will receive it from somebody else who is around you in your life. The words you utter literally designs the karmic flow of your life. It is like, the road you take is going to decide the destination you are going to reach.  The words you start uttering is going to decide the karmic flow of your life.  It can either make or break your life.\n\nSecond important thing I wanted you to know. The words you utter towards you, that is most important than the words you utter towards others; the words you utter towards others and the words you utter towards you. Look in. Constantly, the words you utter towards you, the words you utter towards yourself, I tell you, the words you utter towards yourself immediately can change the way you think about you, the way you feel about you, the way your body, mind, muscles respond. \n\nI tell you, the words, Power of Words is Saraswathi.\n\nPower of Thinking is Lakshmi.\n\nPower of Feeling is Durga. \n\nAll the three are available to us if we know how to harness the power, how to use that power.\n\nPower of Thinking - In one moment you can make anything look like God; within next few moments you can make anything look like demon in your life. Please understand, if you bow down, even a small stone can become a God. If you are afraid of, even God will look like demon.\n\nI have seen, people who are afraid of Completion, the spiritual process, they really can't even face me. I have seen this many time. \n\n'No, no, no. I don't want to come to see him.'Why?  'No, no, no.  Then I may have to give up alcohol. I may have to give up smoking.' \n\nI have seen many people come and tell me, 'Swamiji, my husband doesn't want to come and see you.'\nI ask, 'Why? Why, why is he afraid?'\n'No, he feels if he sees you he has to give up on non-veg and alcohol.'\nI tell them 'No I am not going to ask him to give up non veg and alcohol'\n'No, no, he knows if he sees you he will give up automatically. He is afraid that his life will change.'\n\nEven if they come they will not look in my direction. They will look in the other way. \n\nPlease listen, the Power of Thinking, your logic, can play any side. The way you think is a power for you and people around you. 600 billion dollar US spends all over the word just to promote their lifestyle through media. Please understand, just to promote their lifestyle through media; their way of clothing, eating, dressing. 600 billion dollars every year U.S spends.  Why?  Because, the moment you start thinking the way they want you to think, now you have become a market, a buyer for them - their products. Now whole life you earn for whom?  For them!  Because, if you want to be joyful, you have to do what they are asking you to do, if you think you are joyful, you are going to celebrate the way they expect you to celebrate, the way they want you to spend. \n\nIn those days, when you are happy, you run to the temple. When you are sad, you run to the temple. Now, when you are happy, you run to THE TASMAC. When you are sad, you run to the TASMAC.  TASMAC is alcohol shop in Tamil Nadu. It's a brand for liquor shop.\n\nPlease understand, the thinking, the way you think is going to add either power to you or power to others. The moment America makes you think as they want you to think, then naturally your food becomes what they want, your clothes becomes what they want, your way of living becomes the way they want. So, now, whether you are happy or joyful,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cmW9Njca8_Q/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAszFoE8-PzLjHwT94OYJ5arpslsA","youtubeID":"cmW9Njca8_Q","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"self-world-god-and-humanity-cmw9njca8q"}}
