Realize yourself, you will realize, you and Paramahamsa Nithyananda are one and the same. He promotes Rama, Krishna, Buddha because they are one and the same; he experiences them in his consciousness. So naturally he is promoting them, not someone else.\nExperience God state with God. In the beginning, the experience can happen only with God, then you will experience within yourself. Then you can transmit to others. Doing the energy play is easier for him than talking about it, because it is more like connecting with two beings, but words have to connect with everyone's logic at the same time.\nSame person can listen to same discourse many times and get many different meaning every time at different timings and maturity.\nAll you need to do to experience God with God is stop your ignorance which acts outrageously. Sometimes in the life everyone feels God in some reflection, for example sitting on a hill watching an evening sunset and you feel God in that. Or in seeing some deity you will see God in that space. Some moments your heart will open up and feel God consciousness in that space.  If you loosen up, open up, that space will be filled by God. But your mind is always trying to do something outrageous, holding onto the identity you present to the world. We elect leaders based on whether they appeal to your fantasies.\nRamakrishna said anyone who wants to reach enlightenment must go through this door (pointing to his own body). This wasn't ego, was a fact. Same way, anyone operating beyond their five senses comes across Paramahamsa Nithyananda's form or talks, their consciousness will feel connected. Any seeker exists in this era on the planet has to feel connected if he comes across Paramahamsa Nithyananda. Doesn't have to think logically, just his consciousness will connect.\nAs long as sadistic satisfaction sensory people exist, ignorance can't be destroyed. As long as people are seeking for something more than the five senses, Paramahamsa Nithyananda cannot be destroyed. He revealed that people who are successes in outer world fields will have a deep dissatisfaction within themselves. Their own inner space will be intolerable to themselves. They will constantly be trying to jump out of their frame.\nWhatever you want to experience, you will attract that person in your life. So if you want to experience God, you will attract someone with God consciousness into your life. May you all experience God in your lives.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium. He has inspired over 4 million lives worldwide to a new conscious age of enlightened living and has healed many thousands from chronic diseases and mental problems & traumas.
