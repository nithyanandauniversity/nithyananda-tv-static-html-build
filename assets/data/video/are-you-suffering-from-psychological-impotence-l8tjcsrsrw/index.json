This over remembering thought flow runs like a poison in our minds, putting us into the space of giving up -- we become psychologically impotent. Our life gets stuck in in the habit of thinking that everything is impossible. If we can complete with this inadequate life strategy, we will immediately start on the path to enlightenment. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\nI will start on the process of Living Advaitha, the Teamily.  I will continue.\n\nSee, when you work with all your incompletions, I gave you the time today, with the help of teamily you will pen down all the incompletions you need to complete with to achieve your authentic identity. Please listen!  Just like the same cloth, because of confusion, gets into a knot and fights with the same cloth....it is the same one piece cloth, but when it starts getting confused about itself, when it is not sure about itself, it gets locked here and there and gets knotted. Once the knot happens, the cloth itself is fighting with itself, neither it is going to be useful, nor it is going to have longevity. It will destroy itself. That is exactly what our own inner-space is doing. I don't want to use the word \"mind\" for inner-space, because the word \"mind\" is polluted too much. This is what our own inner-space is doing to ourselves. This is what our own inner-space is doing to itself; that is the right word. \n\nYou can see, the deep tiredness you cherish, kind of a deep-rooted pattern of \"I give up\", that is the source of all your tiredness, boredom and pain.  Don't ever entertain that, please understand. Don't ever entertain that. Whatever field you may be in, you might have achieved the peak of your field, you may have taken up a career in a Company and become the CEO (Chief Executive Officer), but still if you have not completed with the deep-rooted pattern of giving up, you have not seen your peak, please be very clear. You may be accidental Prime Minister, accidental Chief Executive Officer, accidental Chief Minister, accidental religious leader, accidental Adheeenam.  You may not have achieved your full potential.    \n\nPlease listen! See, from the young age people who oppose you, people whom you think are against you, it will not be some top, big guy like a Prime Minister, President of the country is opposing you; it will be the mithaiwala who sells candy in your street corner!  All your enemies will be only that level. You gave fifty paise, he gave candy only for forty-five paise, and five paise he cheated you.  These are the complaints you start developing in your life. When you start building the idea that some people are cheating you, some are exploiting you, slowly, slowly, your over-remembrance about them makes you shrink and stops you deciding in your continuous expansion. That is why in our Gurukul I said, even getting the fruits and eating in the garden.....\n\nRishi Advaith was saying, 'We will get all the mangoes and serve them one day in the lunch or dinner.'  I said, 'Have you eaten like that when you were a child?'  When you steal and eat only, it is tastier! Not when it is served for anyone!  Now you don't even need to use the word \"stealing\". If it is banned and they do it, only then you can call it \"stealing\".  We should not even use the word \"stealing\" for our kids, because we never banned them.  I only tell them, 'Tell your trees, let them give ten times more mangoes, and all of you enjoy; that's all!' So, there is no question of stealing, because they are the owners, they are the inheritors.  So, it is their father's property. You cannot even use the word \"stealing\".  But, anyhow, we always feel it is tastier when we directly pluck, and eat, share only with people whom we love. That is a kind of a pattern.  Anyhow.....it is okay.\n\nListen! The idea I am trying to convey to you is, the over-remembrance of enemy and the enmity constantly tires you.  It is like the A/C machine (air-conditioner) is switched on even when you are travelling somewhere else. Even when you are away, the A/C machine is running day and night! You have gone away four years somewhere, and that A/C machine is switched on, and it is constantly running day and night! It is constantly running whether you are there or not! When you come back, will it have any cooling effect? Please listen, that is exactly what you are doing with your inner-space. The over- remembrance of your enmity and enemy uses all your energy constantly, and when you really need power, you don't have! Like the A/C machine is used all the time, but when you really need it, it will not work, it will not be useful.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L8t_jcSRSRw/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"L8t_jcSRSRw","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-you-suffering-from-psychological-impotence-l8tjcsrsrw"}}
