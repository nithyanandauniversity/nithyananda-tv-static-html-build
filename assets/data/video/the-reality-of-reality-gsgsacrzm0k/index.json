The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 10, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) shares the sacred secret of how to live an enlightened life. When we are attached to our identity, we judge the world through the lens of our beliefs and prejudices. We create imaginary wars with people around us, thinking we know how they feel about us. Nithyananda gives us a technique to shed these fantasy relationships. Approach someone we think of as an enemy and sit quietly with them, asking them to share their honest feelings about us. Repeat this with someone we think of as a friend. We will learn the spiritual skill of impartiality: of treating both friends and enemies with equal respect and compassion.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\n\"Question - Dear Swamiji, is there such a thing as Objective Reality, or is the world nothing but a reflection of my perceptions? Can you also give me some signs to distinguish between reality and fantasy? - Nidhi, Vizag\n \nNidhi, first thing you need to know whatever you understand as reality - the dimensions like a size, shape, quality, your association of good & bad with it - all that - even one quality does not exist in objective reality. Please understand if you think this is wall, this is not wall, whatever you understand -- why this wall, what this wall does, how it looks, what it is, who built, is it good for me, bad for me, all concepts you have about the wall is not there actually on the wall. So In a way I can say there is no such thing as objective reality and there is something called objective reality. There is no such thing as objective reality is also true. There is objective reality is also true. Understand, I tell you there is no such thing as objective reality because anything you see, you perceive -- does not exist as you perceive. And I tell you there is objective reality. Why you know? because you may be liberated from this wall, but the other person who is not liberated, will continue to see this wall as objective reality. Because of that I tell objective reality exists. But I tell you for you objective reality does not exist. So the right truth objective reality does not exist for you, but the objective reality exists for the objects you see in objective reality. But as the objective reality does not exist for you itself, how can the objects you see in the objective reality is objective reality, can be objective reality for you? Listen to the statement again - as the objective reality which you perceived itself is not an objective reality for you, then, how can the objects you perceive in the objective reality can have the objective reality  which you perceive as the objective reality  which is not a objective reality ?\n\n\nSo what you know as reality is nothing but the perversion of your fantasy. What you know as fantasy is nothing but the perversion of your reality. When you go beyond what you know as reality and fantasy you see \"yen\" reality which is eNreality. In enlightened reality there is no space for fantasy reality - reality based fantasy, fantasy based reality. Fantasy based reality is deities. Reality based fantasy is theme parks. Reality based reality is enlightened reality. Fantasy based fantasy is your dreams. The reality based reality awakens in you when you understand neither reality based fantasies and fantasy based realities and reality-reality does not lead you to reality. The reality-reality, fantasy-fantasy, fantasy-reality, reality-fantasy is all finally your reality fantasy leading you from fantasy reality to reality fantasy. Finally, only when you drop everything the reality- reality expresses itself beyond reality! \"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GSgSAcrzM0k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLB4ThoHkQ0n9vCLTR8BjfDHik6uvQ","youtubeID":"GSgSAcrzM0k","viewCount":1440,"eventDate":"2012-09-09","duration":624,"likeCount":37,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-reality-of-reality-gsgsacrzm0k"}}
