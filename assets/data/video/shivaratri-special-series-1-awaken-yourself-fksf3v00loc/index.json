Shiva is described to have experienced inner awakening, traditionally called the raising of the Kundalini. Paramahamsa Nithyananda elaborates on this further in his message by describing the different stories from Shiva's life that actually represent the raising of Kundalini. Next Shivaratri special clip: Awaken Yourself - Kill Manmadha & AWaken Muladhara.\n\nCome, Experience Maha Shivaratri in the presence of living enlightened Master Paramahamsa Nithyananda. Witness the powerful Rudra Homa, take a holy dip in the healing tank - Vaidyasarovar which houses the 21-feet Navapashana (nine elements) Shiva Linga and get blessings from the Master on this auspicious day.
