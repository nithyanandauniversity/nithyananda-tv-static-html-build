The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 16, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) unveils the Middle Path for spiritual seekers. Both the extreme of self-indulgence, eating and sleeping too much, and the extreme of self-abnegation, fasting in constant suffering and torturing oneself with sleeplessness, prevent us from achieving yoga -- union with the Divine. Moderation in every activity is the path to liberation.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.  Today successfully we are ending the Nirahara Samyama Level 3. After a long time, I am also completing. We are ending the Nirahara Samyama Level 3. But immediately I am starting 'THE Samyama'.  Formally I take little bit of Venkateswara's prasadam like a sign of completing the Nirahara Samyama level 3 and today I will give you all, whoever is completing Nirahara samyama level 3, all of them little bit of Venkateswara's prasadam. All of you guys can complete the Nirahara samyama level 3 and start eating. But I am going to continue 'THE Samyama' from today. I am also planning to work on my body. Within next 6 months, I feel I can taper down, even this juice which I am taking liquid, even that I will taper down and become a complete Nirahari. Without even water or any liquid, just to give a statement about the yogic powers, not to be pride of or egoistic about me, what is there? There is nothing. Even if I eat nothing, if I don't eat also, nothing. Just to give inspiration to all you guys about the yogic powers. Just to tell you guys that it is possible. Still it is possible. We have not lost the science. The science is available. Whether you are available or not is the only question. But, the science is still available to the world.\n\nEvery incarnation proves all yogic and spiritual sciences are still alive and available. When I land on the planet earth, the first statement I make is, \"Hey! Still I am alive and available.\" All the yogic sciences and spiritual sciences, inner sciences are available and alive. Now only you have to decide whether you are alive or not, whether you are available to it or not.\n\nI have one more good news. From yesterday, I made myself available on Facebook also.  I was only available in Twitter earlier. Yesterday, I started putting messages on Facebook. SriNithyananda.Swami- that's the  ID. SriNithyananda.Swami. From today, morning satsang will be called as Nithya Satsang and this means we will have satsang every day without missing even a single day.\n\nTill now, 118 requests for Brahmacharya kriya has come. Still more continuously calls and emails are coming. So, because of that I am postponing the Brahmacharya kriya for one or two days. And I also need to end the satsang little early for next 3 -- 4 days because of Malaysia NSP and Tiruvannamalai  NSP. So after the Malaysia and Tiruvannamalai NSP, I will share the Brahmacharya kriya with you all. Because I have to sit and teach the whole one and half hours. And I wanted all the people who are going to practice this on 2-way.\n\nLet us start today's satsang.\n\nIn Bhagavad Gita, 6th chapter, Dhyana yoga, 16th verse.\n\n                naatyash-natastu yogosthi na chai-kaanta-manashnataha |\n\n                na caathi svapna-sheelasya jaagrato naiva chaarjuna ||\n\nIn every respect, o'Arjuna, neither the one who eats too  much or the one who refrains from eating, and neither the one who is sleepy nor the one who is sleepless reach the state of intense action and perfection.\n\nSee the sutra, exactly on the day when we are completing the Nirahara samyama. It is almost like the timing is so perfect with Krishna. That is why I say, you can never call these great Masters in past tense. See, it is exactly telling, today, for ordinary human beings, neither eating too much nor eating nothing, neither sleeping too much nor non-sleeping, both extremes are not right. Please understand, when I say Nirahara, it is not that I make you completely without eating. I make your body receive the energy directly from the ether. So it is totally different.\n\nWhen you become complete Nirahari, the state  you achieve is totally different from what Bhagawan calls here. So, in 6 months I am also going to completely stop eating. I am slowly tapering down. But that does not mean I am doing something against what Bhagawan is saying. No. Bhagawan is giving a certain example because there are some people who stop eating and stop sleeping out of their ego and to get attention from others. My Niraharis don't even remember. They just live.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeFlIrKywyM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDzLHWiZ2XtYy4Wf_2FbhIcTJQQqg","youtubeID":"SeFlIrKywyM","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"is-food-necessary-to-stay-alive-seflirkywym"}}
