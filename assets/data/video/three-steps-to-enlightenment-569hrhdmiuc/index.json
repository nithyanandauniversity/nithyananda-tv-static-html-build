The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 5, verses 27-28, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) unveils the spiritual technology for total living enlightenment. The plan is three-pronged, embracing lifestyle, technique and experience. The lifestyle gives us freedom from anger and desire and establishes the foundation for techniques to succeed. Once techniques are undertaken in a climate of compassion, they generate divine experiences. These in turn create spontaneous evolution within us, producing extraordinary powers. We become jeevan muktas -- super-conscious light beings.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita-5th Chapter -- Sanyasa Yoga -- 27 & 28th Verses\n \nSparshaanKrutvaa Bahir -- baahyaam  Cakshush -- Chaivaantare bhruvo l\nPraana -- panou samou krutvaa Naasaabh -- yantra -- chaarinou ll\nYateendriya -- mano  buddhihir munir moksha paraayanaha l\nVigatecchaa --bhaya krodho yas sadaa mukta eva saha ll\n \nBeautiful, both the verses!\n \nSparshaanKrutvaa Bahir -- baahyaam  Cakshush -- Chaivaantare bhruvo l\nPraana -- panou samou krutvaa Naasaabh -- yantra -- chaarinou ll\nYateendriya -- mano  buddhihir munir moksha paraayanaha l\nVigatecchaa --bhaya krodo yas sadaa mukta eva saha ll\n \nBoth verses together you need to understand.  Let me give you the translation.\n \nThe one who has made the sense objects remain outside, by retaining the sight between the eyebrows being in deep meditation; by balancing the life breath that moves inward and outward through the nostrils; by subduing the senses, the thoughts and the intelligence; having removed desire, fear and anger; being intent upon loosening the bonds, remains always relaxed and free.\n \nUnderstand this few sacred secrets:\nFirst, Bhagavan starts with the life style.  The first line he says is:\nThe one who has made the sense objects remain outside, by retaining the sight between the eyebrows.\n \nThe first part: One who has made the sense objects remain outside - This teaches you enlightened life style. \nThe second statement: Retaining the sight between the eye brows - This is the technique.\n \nPlease understand, enlightened life style prepares you for the extraordinary experiences; techniques gives you extraordinary experiences; Enlightenment, Realization, Samyama gives you extraordinary powers.\n \nSee the three classifications clearly:\nEnlightened life style is more life solution. That prepares the ground, root. Then comes technique, which gives you extraordinary experiences. Then comes Realization -- Anubhava or Anubhooti, which gives extraordinary powers. \n \nIf you see Gnanasambandar's life, Gnanasambandar is one of the great incarnation. He is considered to be the incarnation of Subramanya, Skanda. Because Gnanasambandar had Parvati's breast milk, the enlightening milk, he is considered as the incarnation of subramanya in the Shaiva Siddhanta Tradition. One of the great saints! If you see his life, the experience of Devi appearing and giving enlightening milk to him, leads to the Samyama -- Realization and Expression of extraordinary powers. In his life, the life solutions did not play much role because from the very young age, he had the extraordinary experiences and powers. \n \nIf you understand these three classifications, many of your confusions related to spirituality will disappear.  Many times, people try to think one is enough or one is higher than the other.  Please understand, if you are matured, even one is not necessary.  In these three, nothing is necessary.\n \nAshtavakra, the moment the day he was born, he neither had experience, nor had any powers, lived Enlightenment! \n \nSri Ramakrishna had all the three.  Life solutions, means Enlightened life style and then the extraordinary experiences and Samyama the power, Realization. \n \nIn Gnanasambandar's life, you will see two things.  As a three year old child, he did not study any Shastras.  He did not start going to school.  He did not learn the life style of enlightenment. He did not practice anything. Straight Devi appeared and gave the enlightening milk. And that experience has led to the Samyama --Realization and he started expressing extraordinary powers. \nNeither one is higher than the other nor one is lower than the other.  For ordinary people, all the three are required.  Don't try to have just one, not the other.   If you have only technique, you may have extraordinary powers, but you may not have enlightened life style, the life style of compassion, love;  the nervous system to radiate the joy.  You may be missing that!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/569hRhDmiUc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLClmaIxqmmWUxu7KzkvZQ3O0IxD2w","youtubeID":"569hRhDmiUc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"three-steps-to-enlightenment-569hrhdmiuc"}}
