That is how temples optimize this experience transmission. All temples are expansion of human frame – miniature of the cosmos. All temples are miniatures of the cosmos to transmit this experience to human bodies.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nToday, I wanted to expand on: ‘WHY LARGE-SIZE INFRASTRUCTURES TO EXPERIENCE SHIVOHAM?’\n\nPlease understand, your body is the miniature of the Cosmos.  Actually, one man can give birth to the whole human population!  That is what has happened.  It is from one man only the whole human population has started.  One man can give birth to whole human population, because your body is miniature of the Cosmos. \n\nListen!  Some of the important equations I am deriving.  You need to catch it.\n\n·         Body is miniature of the Cosmos; one.\n\n \n\n·         Second, important, very important truth: In any enclosed space, people who live continuously, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, they start feeling each other’s space and feeling certain kind of a union.\n\nListen!  Please listen!  I will give you this example:  If you all are constantly staying in this campus, by and by, you all feel a certain kind of a connection.  If I awaken ten people’s Kundalini, that bio-memory just jumps, the fire jumps!  It is like a contagious disease.  Please understand, ‘contagious disease’ is the wrong word because it does bad thing.  Kundalini awakening does good thing; but it spreads just like disease only. \n\nRecently, some of the studies, medical studies, I was reading in the Internet.  In a village if you give Polio vaccination for forty percent of the kids, other sixty percent doesn’t get affected even if you don’t give Polio medicine.  If there are hundred kids in the village, if you just give forty kids Polio vaccine, other kids also don’t have the....they don’t get affected by the disease!  It is called ‘ripple effect’.  Even in our Sangha, I can see so many good things spread as a ripple effect.  Sometimes bad things also spread as a ripple effect.  My responsibility is go on creating good things, and allowing that to spread as a ripple effect, and not to allow the bad things to spread as a ripple effect.\n\nUnderstand, in one enclosure how many people may stay, after a certain period you experience a kind of oneness where the spiritual experience spreads, catches in the bio-memory.  I have seen this happening in some of the Vaishnava Paaraayanaas. \n\nI had the fortune of spending some time in Srirangam during my early wandering days, where they will chant that Vishnu stotras, Divya Prabandham.  It is in ancient Tamil.  To tell you honestly, I cannot understand that whole thing.  Those Vaishnavites will be sitting – devotees – and the singers will be standing and singing.  It is actually an art.  It is called the ‘Araiyar Sevai’ (அரையர் சேவை) where the devotee sings Vishnu’s glory.  You don’t need to understand.  Just if you sit in that area, I have seen my eyes will be pouring!  I used to sleep on the banks of the Cauvery, but in the day time I will come and sit in the temple; eyes will be pouring! \n\nListen!  Whatever may be the experience, whether it is Kundalini awakening, enlightenment, it can just be transmitted from one bio-memory to another bio-memory very easily if you all live in one enclosure.  And, temples are systematically built infrastructures to optimize this experience transmission and energy transmission.  Temples are infrastructures built to optimize this experience transmission.  Please understand, all temples are just expansion of the human frame.  Human frame is miniature of the Cosmos.  It means what?  All temples are also miniatures of the Cosmos to transmit this experience to human bodies.  The ‘garbha mandir’, ‘garbha griha’ (sanctum sanctorum) is the energy source; ‘dhwaja sthambha’ – flag pole – is the transformer.  Everyone sits inside that enclosure will feel the very strength and energy and vibration.....will feel the strength and energy and vibration! \n\nUnderstand, this whole Cambodia infrastructure was created for mass enlightenment.  That whole infrastructure was created for mass enlightenment, and it was consistently used for mass enlightenment at least eight-hundred to thousand years.  Later on, whatever may be the reason, may be the brutal attack on enlightened community.....\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/temples-cosmic-miniatures#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eyvgo1RiL2w/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"eyvgo1RiL2w","viewCount":2472,"eventDate":"2014-10-30","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"temples-cosmic-miniatures-eyvgo1ril2w"}}
