When we say NO to societal ignorance and illusion, our thinking moves into alignment with the ultimate possibility! Taking a stand, declaring that we will evolve, be in completion, and always be powerful is the right thinking, action, and intelligence in which our lives should flow.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, I will continue to expand on \"SANNYAS\".\n\n Knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, constantly society pokes at you; society's ignorance is harassing you.  Every response you give to happenings of life to you, every response you give to the bits and pieces of life happening to you, every cognition you do is with the interpretation of the social ignorance. \n\nPlease understand, for example, when somebody harasses you, attacks you, whether you hit him back, attack him back, or keep quiet, both are from social ignorance.  You don't keep quiet for the right reason.  You don't keep quiet with the right cognition.  You don't attack for the right reason.  Whether you attack or keep quiet, both, as long as they are from powerlessness, the social ignorance, you will continue to suffer.  Please understand, responding, cognizing based on social ignorance, and responding based on the ignorance imposed on you, is what I call \"Maya\". \n\nPlease understand, Swami Vivekananda beautifully describes, \"YÃ¡ma ithi Maya\" -- \"That which is not there, but which constantly harasses you as if it is there, is Maya\".\n\nRamakrishna quotes his guru Nangta-Totapuri, Mahant of Mahanirvani Akhada.  He quotes that Nangta (Nangta is the twisted word for Naga), Totapuri used to say, 'The source, life, Cosmos, consciousness, does not allow itself to be experienced as itself. So it always wears the veil of Maya, burkha of Maya.'\n\nSo, listen, whether you attack back or keep quiet, or make somebody else attack, whatever, as long as the cognition is from social ignorance, and the response is based on social ignorance imposed on you, please be very clear, you are in Maya.  Maya - delusion!  Maya - illusion!  It is so unfortunate, invariably, whether you are a beggar in the street or the ruler of a country, your cognition is from social ignorance, your response is from social ignorance. \n\nPlease listen!  If you beat your kids for some reason, when they start crying, just to pacify them you give them candy. That is exactly the way society treats you.  It slaps you and takes away your original knowledge of you, your original state from you.  When you start crying, it gives you a little money, one car, one house, and a post -- president - head of the country, head of the society -- an award, and then, just like how the kids put the Five Star (a brand of chocolate) in the mouth and say, 'My mom is great!  My dad is great!'  Fool, you forget the original state taken away from you.  Reducing your taste to a cheaper level is the work of ignorance, please understand.  Lowering your taste is ignorance. \n\nIf I have to define Maya or ignorance, I'll define it in this one way: \"Lowering your Taste\".  You are supposed to be drinking Amruta (nectar) and be in Samadhi.  Instead, you drink alcohol and be in the ditch where the pigs lick your feet!\n\nLowering the taste is ignorance.  Reclaiming your original taste for life is \"Sannyas\".  Please understand, reclaiming your original taste for life is \"Sannyas\".\n\nRamakrishna used to say, 'Because you cannot drink Ganga water, don't drink the drainage water.  Even if you die travelling towards Ganga to drink Ganga water, it is great; but don't drink drainage water and be alive!'\n\nSannyas is \"aligning your thinking to the ultimate possibility, aligning your thinking to the ultimate reality, aligning your thinking to Integrity and Authenticity.  Awakening all the different powers in you is \"Sannyas\".  Awakening all the various powers in you, awakening all the various possibilities in you, awakening all the various understandings in you, awakening all the various realizations in you, awakening all the various goals in you is \"Sannyas\".  Please listen, awakening you to you is \"Sannyas\".  AWAKENING YOU TO YOU IS \"SANNYAS\"!\n\nSannyas is \"dispelling the darkness in your being in every possible way\".  Raising your taste for life, not as per the society standard, but as per the real reality!  You are supposed to drink nectar and be in Samadhi.  Instead, you drink cheap alcohol and be in the ditch!  Anything you drink other than nectar, your taste has been lowered! So, please listen, cognition in the right angle, cognizing life from reality, is \"Sannyas\".      \n\nI was very recently reading an article.  One of the officials who quit her job in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), she has given an open interview where she explains step by step how a few families exploit the whole world with the myth called \"Money\".","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsgcUVL08hM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBXKNXWtRpkUD3bm6iSLuPzwe8HpQ","youtubeID":"YsgcUVL08hM","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"24"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"awakening-you-to-you-is-sannyas-ysgcuvl08hm"}}
