The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 34, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) speaks on the importance of humility. When we relax into becoming humble our receptivity opens, and we are able to expand from every encounter. Even the trees and stones teach us. To experience their knowledge we must drop into a mode of receiving, of submission. This attitude of surrender raises us to the zone of divine consciousness as we connect deeply with all of life and merge our awareness with the whole universe.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nLet us start our morning satsang,\n \n\n In Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter Gnanakarma sanyasa yoga, 34th verse:\n\"Tadviddhi pranipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa\nUpadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninastattvadarsinaha\"\n \n\nThe translation: Understand these truths: By humble submission through enquiry or by resorting to the one who has perceived, experience, the true and essential nature and who will instruct you to that Cognizance, who will transmit that experience to you. This verse is one of the popular verses of BhagavadGita .\n \n\n\"Tadviddhi pranipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa\nUpadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninastattvadarsinaha\".\n \n\nIt's a very popular verse.\nPlease understand the essence of enlightenment. Bhagavan says very beautifully understand these truths: By humble submission through enquiry or by resorting to the one who has perceived, experienced the true essential nature and who will transmit that experience to you.\n \nThe key word in this whole sutra is \"pranipatena paniprasnena sevaya\". I will tell you, with humbleness and the attitude to imbibe if you move, every stone, tree will teach you. Forget about enlightened master teaching you, that will surely happen. But, if you carry this two attitude, attitude of humbleness and attitude of learning, receiving, imbibing.\n\nYesterday I was talking to one of the bramachari, casually I was mentioning how this whole Madurai Aadheenam is going to be rebuilt. We are going to make the whole thing in to five floor. The opposite property is also going to be our five floor property. That is the maximum allowed limit by corporation. So we are planning and I was telling some of the minute details presented in Meenakshi temple architecture and Kasi Vishwanath temple. Actually I wanted this place to be representing the whole India. So some of the minute details in Varanasi and Meenakshi temple and there is a sun temple in Konarak Orissa which has the huge wheel with 12 spokes. So I was talking about all these minute details how this is going to be built. He was telling how do you see all the details bless us also to get that.\n \nPlease understand so many people who live around me whether they believe I am enlightened or incarnation or not that is different. But all of them are baffled by my awareness and by my memory and the way I put things together. Seeing that everybody is shaken and baffled, that no doubt. It's non controversial. Only my incarnationhood expressing is non controversial but all the qualities of incarnationhood expressing is non controversial. It is non controversial. It cannot be refuted.\n \nBut I will tell you, I tell you really, keeping Chokkanatha and Meenakshi as the witness I give you the secret of this quality; understand, humbleness and attitude of imbibing. When I look at the temple, when I look at an architecture, when I look at a set information, even when I take up a new book to read I completely submit myself with the attitude of imbibing. Understand, people who live around me would have observed, even if I get a new laptop or a machine I will hold it in my hand for few seconds, with all humbleness I submit, to imbibe you as part of me; even newspaper or any book! People who lived around me would have observed it. Anything I touch, first I surrender with humble submission, attitude of imbibing.\n \nPlease understand these are very few spiritual methods I myself practice, still now I practice, this is one of the method or attitude still I practice. I go on practicing. See, unclutching and all I don't practice; I can't do also, that's different, because even to unclutch you need mind; I don't have, I can't practice and pooja, I don't practice. But in this mutt, the Madurai Aadheenam tradition, I am supposed to do pooja every day to the deity of Shiva and Meenakshi. So you should see how I do pooja. It will be very funny. Morning I will sit with the deities and I will pour first the water and fall in to Samadhi and then I will wake up and put the sandal and fall in to Samadhi. It will take at least two hours for me to complete the pooja.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LwewKBLMAn0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBclaKNFDWtl7S1zW_dGpxe70Sixw","youtubeID":"LwewKBLMAn0","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"humbleness-makes-your-life-divine-lwewkblman0"}}
