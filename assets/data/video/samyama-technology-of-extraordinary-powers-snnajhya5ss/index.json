Living Incarnation and Avatar Paramahamsa Nithyananda took his teachings to a higher level when announced he wants all his centres around the world to be mystery schools, adept in Samyama.\n\nSamyama is the science of experiencing and expressing the extraordinary powers and experiences from the super conscious through your mind and body. There are 2 categories of people in the spiritual field: some who experience amazing super conscious experience and expresse those to the world and some others who have experienced extraordinary powers and expressed only those to the world (Great yogis levitating, teleporting, appearing in 2 places at the same time are all extra-ordinary powers).\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda was very clear, \"I want my Sanyasis and Rishis to experience the highest consciousness and express the highest powers to the world. I don't want you guys to be theologians in a seminary. I want you to be flowers in the mystery school where you know experience all the deepest secrets of life, and have the ability to express the extraordinary powers. Break the body and mind to make the yogic body, Vedic mind and eN Living.\"\n\n\"Your body and mind is like clay. Every day you can make it what you want. All you need to do is reclaim it. From today I declare that all our Satsang centers are branches of our Mystery school. We are a Naimisharana, place where the great truths are taught, experimented and people are made to experience it. So I want you all to understand, experiment and experience these truths.\"\n\n\"By Dharana, Dhyana and Samyama, the knowledge is achieved, lighting up of your consciousness happens. You are a human being with all extraordinary possibilities. You are God living in a human body. All extraordinary physical and mental possibilities exist in you. Very simple things of life, you can float in water with a little training. Like acquiring wealth, all human beings should acquire some powers.\"\n\nSamyama gives you the capacity or the power to experience the extra ordinary power and then either enjoy or renounce as you want. But whether to live or leave or experience or express, Samyama is the basic need. I am initiating all of you into the Samyama process. From today we will start the eN Mystery school all over the world.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SnnaJhyA5Ss/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLD4cS1lASOTl43J-NNPy7Z6oSb_lg","youtubeID":"SnnaJhyA5Ss","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"31"},{"id":"32"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"samyama-technology-of-extraordinary-powers-snnajhya5ss"}}
