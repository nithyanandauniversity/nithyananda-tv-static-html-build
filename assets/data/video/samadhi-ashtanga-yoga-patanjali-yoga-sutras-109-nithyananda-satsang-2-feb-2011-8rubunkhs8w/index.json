It's not the end of your spiritual life. It's the beginning of your spiritual life.\n\nFor those who think Paramahamsa Nithyananda is an unattainable goal, he was very clear, \"Samadhi is a space where the stuff out of which both of us are made, both disappear, and it's impossible to get back to the space where you were before the Samadhi. I have sown the seed of Samadhi in all of you; now try to do some rethinking-manana - means soaking your being in this sacred truth.\" \n\n\"All I want you to do is contemplate, do manana of this truth if you can, these few statements I made, continuously let it repeat in your mind. When you meditate on me, your identity, name and form, my identity, name and form, disappearing into a certain frequency is Dhyaan. But the stuff out of which you are made, and I'm made, both disappearing into a certain space, never to come back as they were before, is Samadhi.\"\n\n\"The whole Vedic consciousness is centered on this one word Samadhi. It is so sacred so secret, still this word is fresh even for me. It is too sacred for anybody to think even that they know it. And I am here, very honestly saying to all of you that these words excite me. That is the reason I can go on and on explaining the various dimensions and aspects of Samadhi.\"\n\nIt's time we read the menu, it's time to eat the food, experience Samadhi.\n\nThe video ends with a meditation technique.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8rUbUNkHs8w/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDB_r1AG--2cv7OfXQ-P-ki75jCPw","youtubeID":"8rUbUNkHs8w","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"16"},{"id":"17"},{"id":"32"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"samadhi-ashtanga-yoga-patanjali-yoga-sutras-109-nithyananda-satsang-2-feb-2011-8rubunkhs8w"}}
