When we internalize this verse, we can walk out of any disease. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will directly enter into the satsangh.\n \nThe second verse of Ishavasya Upanishad:\n \nकुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः |\nएवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥\nkurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH |\nevaM thvayi naanyaThethoaAsthi na karma lipyathe nare ||\n \nListen! \n \n“One should decide to live in this world for hundreds of years, all the while doing his deeds dispassionately as sanctioned by the scriptures.  In this way, the deeds done by you shall not cling to you.  There is no other way by which a man can free himself from the bondage created by the deeds.”\n \nListen! The first thing the Upanishads declare: DECIDE TO LIVE! I was expanding on this from yesterday.  Decision to LIVE!  Please listen!  It is not as simple as you think; it is really deep, really deep.\n\nEvery step of life, don’t give up! Go on deciding to LIVE, deciding to LIVE, deciding to LIVE!  In every opportunity, open to live....open to live. \n \nI will give you one small example\n \nThe moment I read the Kaamika Aagamaa.....  The Aagama says, during the puja to Mahadeva, Shiva, all the three “gaana” should be there: Mantra Gaana, Veena Gaana, Veda Adhyaayana.  Mantra Gaana, means, the mantras chanted during puja; and the Veena Gaana; and the Veda Adhyaayana, Vedic chanting.  The moment I read that, immediate next step is: ‘Oh, in these three, only Veena Gaana I do not know myself.  Get me a Veena; I want to learn.’  That’s all!  That’s all is the next step I took.  I asked my Mahant who assists me; I called him and said, ‘Hey, get me a Veena!’  And, I said, ‘Organize a teacher for me!’\n \nConstantly opening for life! \n \nI tell you, you are living as long as you are opening yourself for life.  When I say “life”, I don’t mean just learning new things. \n \nIf you think wealth is life, you should be constantly opening up for wealth and taking responsibility for it till the end of your time, your so-called “end of time”. \n \nListen!  If you think power is your life, you should be constantly opening up to power till the end of your so-called life.\n \nIn every step, whatever you believe as life, opening yourself for that constantly is “saying YES to life”. \n \nListen!  “One should decide to live hundreds of years” does not mean you just decide to breathe, inhale and exhale, for hundreds of years.  No!  Whatever you believe as life, opening up for that!\n \nI am very clear, till the last moment of my life, 127th birthday, may be, by 11, 11:30, noon, I may leave the body in the public stage.  Till then I will be giving my satsangh.  That day morning there will be satsangh, and there will be Kalpataru Darshan, there will be Sannyas initiation, and, after that, I will leave the body.  Means, not that I am going to become non-functioning, I will not be functioning using just this body. \n \nSo, be very clear, what you decide as life, being available for that, and saying “YES” to that constantly is “kurvanneveha karmaaNi jijeeviShechChathgN^ samaaH” (कुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छत्ग्ण् समाः)! \n \nIf you think, money is life, even the last moment of your life you should be saying “YES” to it.\n \nIf you think power is life, even the last moment of your life you should be saying “YES” to it and making decisions for it.\n \nIf you think enlightenment is life, you should be saying “YES” to it even the last moment of your life. \n \nIn my life, I am very clear, living Advaitha and enriching the whole world with the spiritual truth is my life.  So, I am saying “YES” to this till the end of my so-called life.\n \nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:-","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/icgyauKm5hs/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"icgyauKm5hs","viewCount":7498,"eventDate":"2015-02-08","duration":3830,"likeCount":194,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"manual-for-living-say-yes-to-life-icgyaukm5hs"}}
