Watch this satsang again and again because I have revealed so many Mahadev Rahasyas in this. Your life to reach fulfillment and completion nothing else is required other than this one satsang. If you understand and internalize this one satsang, that is enough, you will achieve Completion and fulfillment both.” This is the divine glory of this one Nithya Satsang. \n\nSetting the context, Paramahamsa Nithyananda begins revealing that \n-        “Your attitude towards a person decides whether you are going to be part of his public life, private life, secret life. The same applies towards the Cosmos. If we are part of the private life of Cosmos, we will be an Enlightened Being, if part of public life, then we know the suksma, the subtle nuances of how, why the Cosmos functions. Neither there is a law nor there is a logic in Sadāshiva’s, the functioning of the Cosmos.\n-       Human Beings need to remember only one thing – when Cosmos, Sadāshiva rushes towards you with a tremendous love, when He overwhelms you by His love, when He overflows in you – first don’t doubt, “Am I qualified for it?”\nRevealing the Mahadev Rahasya, the secret of secrets, directly useful for our lives: \no        “the moment you are seeking eternal love or bliss which stays with you – understand you have received incoming call. And you need to know that the individual soul, Jeevātma can only receive the incoming call, he cannot make the outgoing. If there is a Seeking in you, understand Sadāshiva has called you and you have all the right to declare – Sadāshivaoham. Every time a call comes, He is declaring – Shivatvamsi. You are Shiva.” Sadāshiva is not looking for any skill sets or qualifications from us. \no        Seeking is the secret invitation sent by Sadāshiva to be part of His secret life because He has a secret crush on you. He has no use by you but He wants to manifest through you.\no        Every time you declare – SADĀSHIVOHAM – Mahadeva, Sadāshiva rushes Himself to manifest through you, because the Whole by Its very nature wants to manifest and celebrate Its existence through every part. \no        The secret passcode to Sadāshiva – The moment you even have the guts to declare Sadāshivoham, He just feels mesmerized by you and He just lands and manifests through you, whatever you want. Understand this secret code. Over use it to your maximum benefit. He loves to be overused. He celebrates when you overuse Him. He is the limitless resource, does not feel afraid of get overused. He is waiting for you to overuse Him. When you decide, “let me declare and manifest it,” you become part of my secret life. Declare and manifest – “I am Sadāshiva. Let me manifest it.” Sadāshiva is waiting to manifest your declarations.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/W_btm6GpaGI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"W_btm6GpaGI","viewCount":17964,"eventDate":"2016-08-31","duration":2016,"likeCount":512,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-sacred-secrets-of-sadashiva-mahadeva-rahasya-wbtm6gpagi"}}
