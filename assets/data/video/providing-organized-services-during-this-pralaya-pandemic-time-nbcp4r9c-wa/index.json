SURELY WE WILL ALL COME OUT OF THIS PRALAYA, THIS PANDEMIC.\n\n*IF WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO DIE DUE TO HUNGER AND EXTREME POVERTY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FORGIVE OURSELVES. SO I REQUEST ALL THE DECISION MAKERS, WORLD LEADERS, PEOPLE WHO REALLY IMPACT THE WORLD: PLEASE LET US ALL JOIN HANDS AND ALLEVIATE, REMOVE POVERTY AND HUNGER.\n\n*ALREADY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION ARE PREDICTING LARGE NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO HUNGER. I THINK ANYBODY WHO SURVIVES THIS PANDEMIC, PRALAYA...WE WON'T BE ABLE TO FORGIVE OURSELVES FOR LETTING PEOPLE DIE DUE TO HUNGER. HUNGER DEATHS WILL HAUNT US FOREVER. LET US NOT ALLOW HUNGER DEATHS.\n\n*I HAVE DECIDED TO ORGANISE OURSELVES. WE WERE PROVIDING SERVICES FROM KAILASA THROUGH VARIOUS WAYS FROM 1994. THE YOGA PATTABHISHEKAM WAS DONE TO ME AND MY GURUS HAVE ORDAINED ME. FROM THAT TIME, IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY, WE ARE CONTINUING THE SERVICES FOR HUMANITY.\n\n*NOW LET US ORGANISE OURSELVES UNDER THE NEW NAMES. SO TODAY I AM INAUGURATING SIX ORGANISATIONS. WE WILL ORGANISE ALL OUR ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES UNDER THESE SIX ORGANISATIONS:\n1) SAFFRON OM - FOCUS ON WORKING FOR WORLD PEACE, CONFLICT RESOLUTION, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n2) RED OM - MAINLY PROVIDING RELIEF WORK DURING NATURAL CALAMITIES LIKE CYCLONE, TSUNAMI, OR MAN MADE CALAMITIES LIKE WARS. THROUGH THIS WE WILL START WORKING ON REMOVING HUNGER AND POVERTY ALL OVER THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE COUNTRIES WHERE HUNGER IS EXPECTED TO KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AS PER GLOBAL ORGANISATIONS’ PREDICTIONS AND REPORTS.\n\n*I HAVE AN ARTICLE TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL:\n\ntinyurl.com/cascadingcrisis\n\n*THE HINDU DIASPORA ALL OVER THE WORLD IS KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS: WE ARE RICH. THAT IS THE TRUTH. WE ARE ALMOST, THE RICHEST ETHNIC MINORITY IN ALL THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND MANY OF THE MAJOR COUNTRIES FROM USA TO EUROPE TO AFRICA TO AUSTRALIA. WE CAN'T DENY THE FACT WE ARE RICH.\n\n*WE ARE EXTREMELY CHARITABLE - GIVERS. I HAVE SEEN THIS NOT ONLY IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, EVEN MULTIPLE SURVEYS STUDIES BY VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ON THE HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND SOCIOLOGY PROVES AGAIN AND AGAIN HINDUS ARE RICH AND CHARITABLE - GREAT GIVERS!\n\n*IT IS TIME WE HINDUS ORGANISE OURSELVES UNDER THIS BANNER “RED OM” AND START PROVIDING HUNGER RELIEF WORK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I WANT KAILSIANS, I SINCERELY REQUEST KAILSIANS TO START DOING ALL THESE THREE WORKS\n\n1) FINDING WHEREVER THE NEED FOR FOOD IS THERE\n\n2) REACHING OUT TO THE GOVERNMENTS, COUNTRIES DECISION MAKERS WHERE REALLY HUNGER IS PREVALENT AND HUNGER RELIEF NEED TO BE DONE.\n\n*UNITED NATIONS HAS LISTED OUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY EXPECT LARGE NUMBER OF DEATHS MAY HAPPEN DUE TO HUNGER. ALREADY PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTED AND GIVEN US DONATIONS. LET US START GIVING GRANTS AND REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IN NEED AND PROVIDING FOOD FOR THEM\n\n3) LET US REACH OUT TO WEALTHY HINDUS WHO ARE REALLY CHARITABLE AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE SURVEY “RED OM” IS PROVIDING AND ASK THEM TO SHARE THEIR TIME, TREASURE, TALENT.\n\n\nREAD MORE AT: www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4104898016264684","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/nBcP4R9C-WA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"nBcP4R9C-WA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"providing-organized-services-during-this-pralaya-pandemic-time-nbcp4r9c-wa"}}
