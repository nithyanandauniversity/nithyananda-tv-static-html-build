For example, if you declare: “Shivoham - I am Mahadeva”, then it is not false or a myth - it is subjective truth.  If you decide to live Shivoham, then it is truth.  Additionally, attacks on you should not create a doubt in you whether Shivoham is true or false.  It should only strengthen your subjective truth.\n \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nToday I wanted to expand on an important truth – “Subjective Truth”.  Please understand, when I declare Shivoham – “I am Mahadeva” – when I declare “You are Mahadeva”, “You are Shiva”, it is not false, it is not myth; it is subjective truth!  Whoever wants to live it, for them it is truth.  Understand, when I declare “You are Mahadeva”, when I declare “I am Mahadeva”, it is not myth; it is called “subjective truth”.  When I declare “You are God”, when I declare “I am God”, it is not false, it is not myth; it is “subjective truth”.  Whoever catches it, want to live it, for them it is truth.  \n\nUnderstand, this whole world is suffering with the arrogance of trying to harass, abuse, somebody else’s subjective truth, and trying to prove that as a false.  \n\nListen!  Trying to prove somebody else’s subjective truth as false is violence, intellectual violence.  It is terrorism, intellectual terrorism.  Please understand trying to prove aggressively somebody else’s subjective truth as false myth is arrogance. If you believe you are God you have all the right to believe, you have all the right to live like one.  It is subjective truth.  No one has a right to interfere into it.  No one has a right to interfere into it.  Subjective truth.  \n\nHindus have suffered too much of intellectual terrorism. I don’t know whether I am capable of stopping the physical violence and terrorism against the Sanatana Hindu Dharma.  I think I am not cut for that. But I’ll surely stop the intellectual terrorism against Sanatana Hindu Dharma.  Mahadeva has endowed me with all the qualities required.  Mahadeva has given me all the qualities required.  The Saraswathya, Saraswathi!  Ability to choose the right words is “Saraswathi”.  Ability to handle the vast memory is “Lakshmi”.  Courage to tell what you want to tell is “Durga”, “Kali”.  Mahadeva blessed me with all the three.  Surely I’ll protect Sanatana Hindu Dharma from intellectual terrorism.  I don’t know whether I am capable of, whether I am cut for protecting Sanatana Dharma from the religious terrorism, physical terrorism; but surely Mahadeva has endowed me with the ability to defend, protect Sanatana Hindu Dharma from intellectual terrorism.\n\nPlease listen! Most of our subjective truths have been named as a myth, degraded, blasted, abused as false and even we Hindus, Sanatana Dharmis, even we started falling into the deep self-doubt.  See a man who has political power, intellectually if you blast him, he will fall into self-doubt that what he is doing may be not right.  Same way the spiritual people, the intellectual people, the religious people who are completely convinced about what they are and what they are teaching, if you attack them legally, they will shiver and collapse and fall down, fall into the self-doubt – ‘May be, what I am doing is not accepted by God.’  \n\nIt’s an age-old method of collapsing people. I tell you India has suffered so much of, Hindus have suffered so much of legal, illegal atrocities. I am talking about pre-Independence era.  Even after Independence, we have suffered so much of intellectual atrocities, political atrocities for the last thousands of years, legal atrocities, illegal atrocities, intellectual atrocities.  Even we ourselves have fallen into the self-doubt and guilt – ‘Are we living rightly?  Are our ideas practical for life?  Are we living the truth? Is our lifestyle and ideology us right, practical, worthy of living successfully?’  That SDHD started developing even in our own system because of the weakness and powerlessness.\n\nUnderstand, a political leader, because already he has the power and law under his control, he cannot be collapsed if you try to attack him legally. But if you attack him intellectually, he may have self-doubt about himself and collapse.  That is the way the kings were collapsed traditionally.  If you want to collapse a king, attack him intellectually.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/live-your-subjective-truth#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oyU4LNIDKyk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"oyU4LNIDKyk","viewCount":2070,"eventDate":"2014-11-29","duration":916,"likeCount":54,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"live-your-subjective-truth-oyu4lnidkyk"}}
