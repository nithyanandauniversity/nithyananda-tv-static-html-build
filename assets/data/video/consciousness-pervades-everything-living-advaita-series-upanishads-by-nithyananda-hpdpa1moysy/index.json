Paramahamsa Nithyananda introduces us into the first verse of the Isha Upanishad. Isha is Consciousness and Intelligence. It is not only the Source or base material of the Universe but it is responsible for keeping everything together, including the base; it permeates everything, even our forms, holding them together. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n \nI am entering into the first verse of the Upanishad.  Before entering into every verse, I feel like wipe yourself completely, clean, be fresh, so that this verse enters into you as nectar and starts functioning.\n \nListen!  Listen!  Listen!\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥ 1 ॥\n \nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nRecite along with me.\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥ 1 ॥\n \nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥ 1 ॥\n \nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nThe translation:\n \nBy the Consciousness enveloped must this all be,\nwhatever moving thing there is in the moving world.\nWith this renounced you may enjoy.\nCovet not the wealth of anyone at all.\n \nListen! \n \nBy the Consciousness enveloped must this all be,\nwhatever moving thing there is in the moving world.\nWith this renounced you may enjoy.\nCovet not the wealth of anyone at all.\n \nListen!  “Eesha”!  Understand this word.  This word means “Consciousness which has all the auspicious qualities, and which is causal, actual material source of everything is, which we may know or we may not know.  And, it is not only the source; it permeates.”  Please understand, “Eesha” is not just the source of these plants, stones, you, me; it continues to permeate, fill all of us and everything is, even when we are in this form.\n \nListen!  The consciousness is not just the source; it is the base.  Not just the base material; it continues to be the base which keeps the material together in this shape.\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\n “By the Consciousnessness enveloped must this all be.”\n \nListen! The word “vaasyam” means “must”.  “Must”! There is no “may be”, “might be”, “can be”, “could be”. No! It is a declaration. Declarations are expected to be used as a basic cognition in our tradition. No other spiritual tradition gives so much space for question-answer and debate, and no other spiritual tradition is so conclusive and inclusive.\n \nListen! Inclusiveness always takes away the conclusiveness. Inclusiveness always takes away the conclusiveness. ‘Oh, everything is one and the same. Everything is.....’.  The inclusiveness takes away the conclusiveness. But, here, inclusiveness and conclusiveness in Completion!  Inclusiveness and conclusiveness in the space of Complete Completion!  Vedic Tradition is the first and foremost, one and only, inclusive and conclusive tradition.\n \nUnderstand, inclusiveness is always the extreme of emotion. Conclusiveness is always the extreme of logic. Both never go hand in hand. Only if the logic and emotion, both merge and see the reality..... Logic always operates from fear. So, it goes on dissecting, dissecting, dissecting, dissecting. Emotion always operates in the space of greed, and it tries to go on adding, adding, adding.\n\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:-video/consciousness-pervades-everything-living-advaita-series-upanishads-nithyananda#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HPdPA1MOysY/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"HPdPA1MOysY","viewCount":8403,"eventDate":"2015-02-06","duration":3272,"likeCount":252,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"consciousness-pervades-everything-living-advaita-series-upanishads-by-nithyananda-hpdpa1moysy"}}
