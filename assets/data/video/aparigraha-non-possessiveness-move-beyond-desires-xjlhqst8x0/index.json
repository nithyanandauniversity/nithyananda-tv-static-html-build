In this talk Nithyananda discusses how one binds himself with insecurity and desires of people and things around himself. He asks one to deeply analyze and see that one cannot enjoy the things around if he/she is bound to hold on to these things. He says that non possessiveness is always discussed by Mahavira after non violence because only the one established in non violence is also capable enough to liberate himself from possessions. He authoratively declares that dropping desires is foolishness and hence increasing ones inner space to accomodate all the desires is the real trick.
