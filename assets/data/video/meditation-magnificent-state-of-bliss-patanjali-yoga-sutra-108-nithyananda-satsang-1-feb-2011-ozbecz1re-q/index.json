Then what is the use of the meditation? This is one more Sacred secret. Uninterrupted flowing of mind is not Dhyaan. Dhyana is a state in which both lose their boundary. Even if anyone retain this boundary, Enlightenment cannot happen. You can meditate on anything and if the boundary is lost, you can become enlightened.\"\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda explained that this is a subtle difference but a very important difference. This sacred sentiment behind the word Dhyaan should be understood. Boundarylessness is the goal of meditation, rather than the object of the meditation.\n\n\"Right understanding of the cosmic law should be had and it will play a major role in the way you think, strategize and run your life,\" he emphasized.\n\n\"Tatra pratyaya - raising the frequency to the level where the object and the mind lose their independent boundaries. If you think Dhyana is concentrating on one object, you will get into a lot of problems.  It's like people taking celibacy vows and then how to maintain the celibacy and their image becomes the main focus. This is a perversion. I have seen people getting into perversions in the name of Dhyana. The purpose will be lost. Suffering and irritation can result.\"\n\nWhen you raise your frequency, you will have intense joy, peace and bliss. Not only the mind but the object on which you have been meditating lose their boundary and become one with the ORIGIN FROM WHERE BOTH CAME OUT. Understand this when you do your Dhyana.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OZbeCZ1re-Q/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCOrRaURyp34bCk_4Dp9dnW7HpiwQ","youtubeID":"OZbeCZ1re-Q","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"16"},{"id":"17"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"meditation-magnificent-state-of-bliss-patanjali-yoga-sutra-108-nithyananda-satsang-1-feb-2011-ozbecz1re-q"}}
