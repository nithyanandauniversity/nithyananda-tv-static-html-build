In society, we have been taught to only focus on body- building which has a severe depreciation value, diminishing as we age. But when we build our identity with Authenticity, based in consciousness, our appreciation value raises exponentially, increasing as we age. Authenticity is building the Being to live in the space of Advaita.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS\n\nI was shown a reply by a rich man to a pretty girl who has advertised in a dating website that she wants to marry a rich man.  When the reply was brought to me, I told Jnanatma that I will comment on it.  I first wanted to read out the whole article.  This pretty girl was seeking a rich husband, and the reply she got from a banker was priceless.  The following I am just reading out.  Then I will give you some of the deeper insights.    \n\nThe following is what a women posted on a dating forum seeking a rich husband:\n\n\nI'm going to be honest of what I'm going to say here. I'm 25 this year. I'm very pretty, have style and good taste. I wish to marry a guy with $500k annual salary or above. You might say that I'm greedy, but an annual salary of $1M is considered only as middle class in New York. \n\nI'm here humbly to ask a few questions:\n\n1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym)\n2) Which age group should I target?\n3) Why most wives of the riches are only average-looking? I've met a few girls who don't have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys.\n4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married)\nMs. Pretty\n\n\nA philosophical reply from CEO of J.P. Morgan below:\n\nDear Ms. Pretty,\nI have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor. My annual income is more than $500k, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I'm not wasting time here.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain. ...\n \nHowever, there's a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can't be prettier year after year. ...\n \nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a \"trading position\".\nIf the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term -- same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or \"leased\".\n \nAnyone with over $500k annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you ... And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with $500k annual income. This has better chance than finding a rich fool.\n\nHope this reply helps.\n\n\nSigned, J.P. Morgan CEO\n\n\n---------------------\nListen!  You are never given the knowledge about building the Being!  Authenticity is building the Being.  ...\n\n\nAll the Swamis, Mahants, Kotharis, Thanedars, devotees, disciples, today your homework is, if you have done your Completion with the teamily, the next step is, define your new identity which you want to cause:\n\n\n§  the new inner-image you want to have,\n§  the outer-image you want to show,\n§  the others-image -- how you want to be perceived by others,\n§  and life-image -- how you want to perceive the world. \nPen down all the four, post it on my Facebook wall; not in my inbox, please don't inbox me; only put it on the Facebook wall. I bless you all! If you have not yet finished the teamily Completion, finish that, and then pen down this.  You have time till tomorrow morning satsangh to finish your teamily Completion.  And the people who have finished, for all of them this is the next step -- identity-building, the right identity-building.  Only you can be liberated from the consciously-built identity, you can become mindless only from a mind which you built consciously, not before that.  You can go beyond the mind only jumping from the mind which you built consciously, not from the unconscious mind.  Unconscious mind can never be a jumping pad from mind to no-mind.  Only consciously-built mind can be a jumping pad from mind to no-mind","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SKNvadLERbo/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"SKNvadLERbo","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"build-the-right-identity-sknvadlerbo"}}
