When it penetrates into the being, our whole body vibrates with this space, sending the intense waves of Shivoham to the world. The more we expand and experience and the more we live Shivoham, the more we become enlightened.  Decide to merge into that space of Shivoham!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n\nAs I committed, I’ll continue to expand on Keep It Simple Shivoham Series. Keep It Simple Shivoham Series.\n\nListen. Today let us all invoke Mahadeva into our being so that he can make us experience Shivoham, just like he gave this same experience to Devi.  I don’t know how many millions of years before, but on this very day, Karthigai Deepam day, which is falling on this year December 5th, Devi was given that Shivoham experience by Mahadeva. We are celebrating the same Brahmotsavam. We are celebrating the same festival as a ten-day festival, Brahmotsavam.\n\nFirst thing, from today, till January 13th, means Nithyananda Brahmotsavam – my birthday – till then, all over the world, we will also do, and we will inspire millions of people to chant and reside in the space of Shivoham, at least thirty-eight crore times. If one person continues to reside in that space and does Ajapa Japa of Shivoham, he will do at least one-lakh times, understand.  When you do Ajapa Japa, it is not that every second you chant once; your heart chants, your lungs chant, your throat chants!  The depth, more and more depth it goes into your being, more and more parts of your being resonates with that Shivoham! So, only when you start, it will be like every second you will chant once – Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham; but by second day, third day, especially if that space has started penetrating into your dream. First it will penetrate as a word; then you will see it will penetrate as a space.  As long as it remains as a word, I can say, once a second, japa will happen. When it penetrates into the being, your whole body is vibrating.  So it cannot be counted as once; it cannot be counted at all!  Your whole being is constantly sending the intense waves of Shivoham to the world!  Let’s make at least a few lakh people radiate the space of Shivoham and culminate it into Adi Rudra Maha Yagna, with the central theme of “Shivoham”.  \n\nJanuary 11, 12, 13, we are going to have Adi Rudra Maha Yagna with 108 Homa Kundas, 108 priests, trained priests, sitting and chanting, doing Rudra Homa continuously, with all our sannyasis, brahmacharis, devotees, gurukul kids, rishis, all of them also joining.  \n\nLet’s make this great offering to Mahadeva and surrender to him, asking him to shower all of us with the experience of Shivoham.  \n\nAnd enrich as many numbers as possible.  All the Kotharis, Thanedars, Mahants, devotees, disciples, when you are going for “bhiksha prachaara yatra” every day, request people to chant Shivoham.  Give “naama dhaana”.  Formally, with the grace of Mahadeva, I give you all now the naama dhaana, Shivoham,Maha Vaakya dhaana, Shivoham, and I authorise all of you go round and give this Maha Vaakya dhaana, Shivoham.  It is Maha Vaakya and Maha Mantra, both!  \n\n“Mantra” means: Worshipping the Lord.  “Maha Vaakya” means: Realizing you are the Lord.  In this “Shivoham”, both happen!  In “Aham Brahmasmi”, only realizing you are the Ultimate happens; Maha Vaakya.  In “Namah Shivaya”, only worshipping Mahadeva happens. In this “Shivoham” both happen!  When you say, “Shivoham” – “I am Shiva” – it means what?  You are surrendering you to Shiva, you are offering you to Shiva, you disappear into him, you relax into him, you rest into him!  So, “Shivoham” is Maha Vaakya and Maha Mantra, both together.    \n\nGo around and give Maha Vaakya dhaana, Maha Mantra dhaana, naama dhaana.  And make as many people as possible chant Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham!  Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham!  Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham!  Shivoham, Shivoham, Shivoham!  Shiva! Shiva!\n\nBe in the space of Shivoham, and help everyone chanting and being in the space of Shivoham.  Help everyone to be in the space of Shivoham.  Shivoham!  Shivoham!  Shivoham!\n\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/change-world-chanting#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/AZogBYj4JBI/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"AZogBYj4JBI","viewCount":6359,"eventDate":"2014-11-26","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"change-the-world-with-chanting-azogbyj4jbi"}}
