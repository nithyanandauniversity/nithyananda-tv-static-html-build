His Divine Holiness tells us how we can experience Ananda in different ways. We are told how we can begin to understand the logic of Ananda, meaning that we will be able to capture the feeling of Ananda more and more consistently. Swamiji tells us to celebrate the Ananda, only then will we begin to see that our inner space starts to fill with courage!\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
