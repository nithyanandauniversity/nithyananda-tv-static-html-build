Only a person whose 'inner image', i.e. the idea you carry about you, is integrated and authentic to the know the Sacred Truths, Dharma can declare and create a will that – May the Dharma, may Sadashiva manifest in me, for I am devoted to knowing and experiencing Him. Sadashiva has revealed atleast 200 techniques of Completion. The science of WILL is the highest form of Completion. \nShanti Mantra Revealed    \nmā mā brahma nirākarod-anirākaraṇamstva-nirākaraṇam me’stu |\ntadātmani nirate ya upaniṣatsu dharmāste mayi santu te mayi santu ||\nauṁ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ ||\n\"\"May Brahman never deny me or withdraw Its grace from me. Let there be no separation. Let me have Completion with Brahman, the Consciousness; and let Brahman be complete with me. So be it.\nMay all Dharma, the Sacred Truths declared by Upaniṣads be fully manifest and radiate in me, who, am integrated and authentically devoted to knowing and experiencing of that Truth, Ātma, the Self. May they manifest and radiate in me.\"\"\n\nHis Holiness also gives the jewels of Yoga, the original Vedic sciences. Hinduism or Vedic tradition and Yoga are inseparable. The moment one practices even Surya Namaskar, one becomes a practicing Hindu. For a true Yoga seeker, the original Sanskrit scriptures become the Source language to learn the pure Vedic Yogic sciences and Truths. By thinking in Sanskrit, the language or vibrations of Divine, one becomes enlightened.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cFxX_UpUqJc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"cFxX_UpUqJc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"declare-completion-with-brahman-the-consciousness-cfxxupuqjc"}}
