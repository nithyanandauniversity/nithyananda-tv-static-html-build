The Records tell us that renunciation is the natural process whereby human beings renew themselves. When attachment takes place it creates an artificial identity: the individual becomes identified with the source of attachment. Shedding this external identity clears the way to enlightenment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nRenunciation is nothing but the ability to rejuvenate yourself continuously by dropping the different identities you create for certain purpose, but unfortunately associate yourself with it, feel one with it. Renunciation is of different levels; renouncing the external wealth which you decide to possess and identify yourself with it, renouncing the name and fame with which you identify yourself and possess and feel as one with, renouncing people with which you identify yourself, possess and feel one with, renouncing the identities which you possess and identify yourself and feel one with. Among these renunciations, renouncing the identity is the ultimate renunciation.\n\nRenunciation is the most intelligent thing a living being can do because renunciation continuously rejuvenates and creates a possibility for higher expressions in your being. When the highest expression happens, you cross the border of renunciation and renunciation itself becomes your very being. When your very core becomes renunciation, the constant purification, a continuous intelligence shining becomes your life.\n\nConstantly renouncing thoughts is unclutching, living renunciation as a lifestyle is living enlightenment. Ajapa japa is a powerful way of renouncing the words and thoughts continuously happening in you. Feeling connection is a powerful method to renounce all the emotions which are not necessary happening in you. Unclutching is the ultimate renunciation, renouncing all the identities which are unnecessary happening in you. Renunciation is the ultimate purification process to live enlightenment.\n\nQUESTIONS & ANSWERS\n\n\nThe first question on renunciation we have is from Ravi from Vancouver, Canada: 'Dear Swamiji, why should one become neutral to physical needs?'\n\nThe why do not does not have answer. When the spiritual evolution happens, when spiritual powers are unfolding through your body, becoming neutral to physical needs just happens. As a flow of life this expresses naturally in you.\n\nHe is also asking, 'Isn't the very creation of male and female and the senses also the gift of Existence?\n\nExistence provides everything including poisons. It is up to you to use what you want and live the way you want based on the goal you want to reach and the purpose you feel as your life's mission.\n\n'While savoring the gift of Existence, can't we achieve the same highest coherence that we can achieve through renunciation?'\n\nWhether you savor or renounce, in the end, only when the identities are renounced highest is achieved. Even what you call as savoring, in the end only when you are able to renounce the identity, the base, ultimate is achieved. Whatever you understand as savoring will not lead you to the ultimate and whatever you understand as savoring will not lead you to achieve the ultimate truth. Whether you live with it or leave it, identity needs to be dropped. Only when you renounce the identity ultimate is achieved. If you can renounce the identities, even if those things are around you, you will achieve the ultimate. If you can't renounce the identity, even if you physically move away from those things you may not be able to achieve the ultimate. Finally everything boils down to renouncing the identities.\n\n'The next question is from Sri Nithya Gnanaprabhananda: 'What is the true meaning of renunciation in the path of sannyas?'\n\nRenouncing all the outer world objects, which you feel as your possession become one with it out of your delusion, renouncing all the people, renouncing all the places, renouncing all the pleasures, renouncing all the thoughts, renouncing all the identities; renunciation in its complete pure form is sannyas. The sannyas, even the training of the sannyas done by an incarnation constantly reminds you into the renunciation and puts you in renunciation.\n\nThe next question is from Joyce: 'How are freedom and renunciation related?'\n\nRenunciation is freedom, freedom means renunciation.\n\nThe next question is from Estelle Reiter from France: 'Dear Mahadeva and Kalabhairava, dear Master, I listen to many of Swamiji's videos and I realize that I have a deep misunderstanding about renunciation and so many questions are coming up. How do I know whether my bio-memory is ready for renunciation?'\n\nAll bio-memories by nature programmed for renunciation. It is your mind which goes against the renunciation, creates more and more troubles and identities, misconceptions.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ANnfmEK9p50/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAsQymGDJKaDIXFZMaSSJSrPUvvwg","youtubeID":"ANnfmEK9p50","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"24"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"akashic-readings-on-renunciation-part-1-annfmek9p50"}}
