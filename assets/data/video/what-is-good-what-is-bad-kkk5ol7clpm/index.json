What is Bad?","slug":"what-is-good-what-is-bad-kkk5ol7clpm","description":"Today’s (21st February, 2015) Morning Satsang continues with the Upanishads Series - Living Advaita.\n\nIsha Upanishad–Verse 3 begins:\n\nasuryā nāme te lokā\nandhena tamasā’vṛtāḥ |\ntāṁs te pretyābhigacchanti\nye ke cātma-hano janāḥ || 3 ||\n\n\nIn this profound delivery of the Isha Upanishad, Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals the simple Truths from the Cosmos of what is good or bad, right or wrong, high or low, and so on. The answer revealed can be used to answer all our questions in life. When life or our own inner self teaches us new lessons and our aspirations get mature, using our powerfulness will expand and move us to even higher aspirations. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLet us start on the third verse of Ishavasya Upanishad:\n\nअसुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः ।\nताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥\n\nAsurya naama they lokaa andhena thamasaavruthaah |\n\nThaagumsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah ||\n \n\nListen!  Please listen!  No one is good, no one is bad.  If somebody does the actions which fulfil your ambitions, you call them as “good”.  If somebody does actions which are not fulfilling your ambitions, you call them “bad”.  No one is right, no one is wrong.  No one is good, no one is bad.  Deciding somebody is good or bad, right or wrong, is purely dependent on how much they are supporting your ambition.  So, what Cosmos answers, what is the answer of Cosmos for this issue?\n\nThe Upanishads, please understand, Upanishads are Dharma declaring its authority and authenticity by itself.  No human-being is involved in it.  No human vested interests are involved in it.  No!  Here, no Prophet, no Messenger, no Son of God, not even God, is involved, understand?  Hindu Tradition is so bold, God has only second place!  The Dharma, Upanishads, stand taller than the concept of God, understand?  It stands taller than the concept of God! \n\nWhat is the opinion of Cosmos?  What is the opinion of Universe?  How does the universal intelligence address this problem of high and low, right-wrong, good-bad?  Because, our perceptions of good and bad, right and wrong, is far away from the fact or the truth; forget about reality.  What is the Cosmos’ opinion about who is good, who is bad, who is becoming more and more good, who is becoming more and more bad, who is doing more and more right, who is doing more and more wrong, what is right, what is wrong, who is right, who is wrong, who is good, who is bad?  Because, Upanishads have to declare this to the universe, they have to declare, they have to reveal this to the universe.  We have not even attributed Upanishads to gods, or even “The” God.  No!  We wanted to retain the authority and authenticity as it is.  We left it as “apourushya”, as it was done, revealed, understand?  Our rishis don’t even want to attribute these Upanishads to any gods, goddesses, “The” God.  No!  They said, ‘It is the Cosmos declaring its authenticity and authority to itself.’  So, what Upanishads want to say about good and bad, right and wrong, high and low, in these last three verses Upanishads are declaring beautifully the whole science of life, almost all the questions of good and bad, right, wrong, who is higher, who is lower, why somebody is enjoying, somebody is suffering.  Everything is clarified, understand?  Upanishads don’t answer question by question.  They just bombard the questioner!  Upanishads, if they answer hundred of your questions, they will make you question millions of your answers!  You questioning many of your answers using these sutras is what I call “internalizing”, “manana”; means, you questioning many of your answers using the truths of Upanishads, revelations of Upanishads. \n\nI wanted the Bidadi Nithyanandeshwara Temple to be a golden temple mainly to engrave this whole Upanishads in golden letters.  And, all the 108 Upanishads will be engraved in stone in golden letters in Bidadi.  It is the Cosmos declaring its authority, Cosmos revealing its authority and authenticity.\n\nHere, Upanishads declare right and wrong, good and bad, reveal the sacred truths about right, wrong, good, bad, to the universe. \n\nLINK OF FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/what-good-what-bad#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KKK5ol7clpM/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"KKK5ol7clpM","viewCount":10605,"eventDate":"2015-02-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"what-is-good-what-is-bad-kkk5ol7clpm"}}
