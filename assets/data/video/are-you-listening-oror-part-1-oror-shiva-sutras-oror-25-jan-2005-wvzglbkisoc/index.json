If the urge has become urgent, if the question has become a question and if the longing for enlightenment is authentic, then deep listening is required. Only when we have entered into the state of deep listening can we truly understand the Sutras and experience the ultimate beyond the questioning mind. \n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
