The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 30, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) emphasizes the clarity of Sri Krishna's teaching. Krishna does not leave any space for misinterpretation in his description of prana samyama, the practice of self-remembrance. If we do not achieve recollection of the self by offering all of our actions to the prana, we cannot even reap the rewards of ordinary life, never mind advancing spiritually! This practice is so fundamental to living a fruitful existence that without it we cannot even call ourselves alive. Once we establish ourselves in self-remembrance, everything awakens within us and life becomes juicy and vibrant.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nYesterday officially we inaugurated our center in Sri Lanka Matta Kallapa, Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam is formed officially in Sri Lanka in Matta kallappa. I have donated from Dhyanapeetam one crore rupee and in Ceylon money 2.5 Crore. It will soon be transferred legally to Sri Lankan Institution. I have already allotted, now it will be transferred. All our social service activities in Sri Lanka, mainly for the people who were affected by the war will start in full fledged way.\n\nSee, Tibetans are also persecuted but they lost their land. Tibetans lost their land but they survived by keeping their culture, spiritual tradition alive! Now, Sri Lankan Tamils also should do the same thing. You might have lost in the political war but don't lose in the cultural war. Keep your culture alive, keep your tradition alive, keep your spiritual strength alive. Through that you can come back always! You can always come back.\n\nSee now Dalai Lama is having a big coming back. I hope and expect and bless Let Tibetans get their land back. Same way I assure O people of Sri Lankan Tamil, I assure - Keep your culture, spiritual tradition alive. You will get your land back.\n\nAnd today, I have one more wonderful news for all you guys -- 57 big organizations, not small, Big organizations are gathering today together in Madurai to have Madurai Adheenam Protection Committee. Please understand, 52 big organizations. Actually in that -- one organization has 4300 organizations under them. So, totally around 4350 organizations are supporting us. Today they are all gathering to give a press meet.\n\nAnd I've also one more good news for you guys -- 400 people have taken up yesterday  - the praana samyama. The praana samyama is now being practiced from day before yesterday by 400 people across the world and once you all complete the 21 days, I'll initiate you all in hunger-free and thirst-free samyama and now I have been very successful in making your system function without losing energy or any basic things and without having food. I'm very successful in initiating people. We'll be able to do it.\n\nLet's enter into today's satsang, In Bagavad Geeta 4th chapter Jnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga 31st verse.\n\n\"Yagya-Shishtaa-Mruta-Bhujo Yaanthi Brahma Sanaatanam\n\nNaayam Lokostya-yagnyasaya kutonyak-kurusattama\"\n\nYagya-Shishtaa-Mruta-Bhujaha Yaanthi Brahma Sanaatanam, Naayam Lokosti yagnyasaya kutah anyaha kurusattama\n\nThe new translation \"The one who experiences the state of imperishableness that remains after sacrifice moves to the state of external expansion but for the one that does not sacrifice even this ordinary life is not there. What to say about other worlds, other states of being, O best among Kurus.\"\n\nIf you understand this one verse, you will iunderstand the impact of praana samyama on your life. Bhagwan is continuously addressssing about praana samyama in this verse also. He says \"having tasted the nectar of the results of such sacrifices\" -- Please understand, here the word \"sacrifice\" means offering all your actions into praana -- means being established into praana, the self-remembrance, even while you are functioning in all actions, even while you are doing all actions.\n\nBhagwan is continuing actually last 3 verses are on the same subject Praana samyama. He is telling you about the benefits and now he is telling - If you are not established in praana, self-remembrance, even this world you won't get., what about the other worlds -- forget about it. He is very clear. He is making it very clear categorically. Please understand -- Sri Krishna have a very logical and systematic, strategic brain! He is not Bhole Baba, like Shiva. If you read whole Shiva Sutras, not a single instruction is categorical! He says, if you want meditate on the heart center. If not meditate on the agnya centre. If not -- sit observing your breath. If you read the whole Shiva Sutras, it is all about options.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vMmXBqhU9M0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAKc3SB8gPec6vspa5HfHmDD_r4AQ","youtubeID":"vMmXBqhU9M0","viewCount":3273,"eventDate":"2012-05-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"establish-yourself-in-self-remembrance-vmmxbqhu9m0"}}
