Surrender does not mean giving up -- it comes from a place of powerfulness and devotion. When we practice completion, we are surrendering the weakness of incompletions within us. When we surrender our incompletions, in a state of completion, we fall in love with our higher Self, experiencing the ultimate reality.\n\nThis video provides links to the following video's:\nInnocent Surrender Not Ignorant Surrender\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MfUc3pJ_B8\nLet your Romance become Devotion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baUjMQC-4Yk\nNithyananda: Ramana Maharshi Is My First Love\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-UxRwrClk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings. \n\nI'll move to today's satsangh subject: How the Science of Completion, when added with the devotion, becomes a powerful experience of liberation.\n\nPlease understand, first time I am going to connect these two sciences -- Science of Completion, and Science of Surrender. In the traditional Bhakthi literatures, the Dasa Parampara, Kanaka Dasa, Purandara Dasa, Vittala Dasa, Bhakthi Sampradaya now the great Shaiva Nayanmars and Kanakadasa, Purandara Dasa, Vittala Dasa, Dasa Parampara, the great devotees like Meera, Andal, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, from the Narada Bhakthi Sutras, the whole Bhakthi Sampradaya, finally evolves to the ultimate surrender. We call it \"Atma Sharanagathi\". And the Science of Completion is from the Advaita Sampradaya, Yoga Vedanta Sampradaya and the Science of Surrender is from the Bhakthi Sampradaya, how both complement each other.  \n\nPlease understand, ultimately the Complete Completion happens when you don't even bother about Complete Completion. Even the desire or the effort for the Complete Completion is surrendered. Even when that effort is surrendered at the feet of the Divine, the Complete Completion happens.\nThe Science of Surrender..... Please listen, listen sincerely and intensely. The more and more and more Completion you do, the more and more and more the surrender starts happening in you.  \n\nI need to define \"surrender\". \"Surrender\" in no way starts with powerlessness or gives you the powerlessness experience or ends in powerlessness. Surrender starts with powerfulness, leads you from power to more powerfulness, ends in ultimate powerfulness.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rl9XawNi_AM/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"rl9XawNi_AM","viewCount":9512,"eventDate":"2014-02-17","duration":1547,"likeCount":256,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"7"},{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"fall-in-love-with-your-higher-self-combining-the-science-of-completion-and-surrender-rl9xawniam"}}
