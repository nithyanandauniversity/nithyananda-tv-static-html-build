The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 7, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) gives us a deep technique for establishing our supremacy of self. Whether we are disturbed by external situations or internal emotions, they can only distract us if we agree to be distracted. When we sit in meditation with awareness and examine the source of the disturbance: how it feels, how it affects us, what is actually happening in our attention, we separate our spiritual consciousness from the experience and it no longer influences us.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome you all with my love and blessings. Today,  Nirahar Samyama  third level is starting. First day!  I am also going to do Nirahar Samyama with you guys. I am continuing all my activities and routine. So this batch of Nirahar Samyama, 3rd level, next 11 days I will also be part of you guys.  So 'The Samyama', 15th day successfully!\n\nIn Bhagavad Gita, 6th chapter - Dhyana Yoga, 7th verse:\n\nJitatmana prashantasya, paramatma samahitaha l\n\nSheetoshna sukh dukheshu, tatha mana apamanayoho ll\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe one who has conquered the self, who has attained tranquility, the supreme is already reached, such a person remains in this state in happiness or distress, heat or cold, honor or dishonor. \n\nI will give you the new translation also:\n\nThe one who has subdued his self, self made of patterns and is firmly established in the supreme state, remains centered whether in cold or warm atmosphere, whether he is pleasant or unpleasant situation whether he receives respect or is dishonored.\n\n Understand Bhagavan is giving powerful technique. He is using beautiful word, sheetoshna samdukheshu, sheeta, ushna -warm or cold, attacks you from outside skin. Sukha, dukkha  atttacks you from inside the skin.\n\nUnderstand when you are feeling warm or cold, just sit and see what is happening outside your skin all over the body. Without branding, just see what is going on, how I feel. Don't name it as a cold or warm; pain or suffering. Just look. Something is going on; let me see what happens; how that feeling touches my skin ; after that how the skin is processing that information; and how I am getting agitated or irritated for no reason; how I am responding to it; why should I get agitated or irritated? Let's see how that nature responds to it. Sit with deep patience. All you guys are now in Kodaikanal. You don't need to go in search of a place. Sit today in the cold and see what happens in your skin. In one day, you will master cold. Cold will not affect you anymore.\n\nSame way heat, do Pancha Tapas, make a fire circle. It is very easy.  Your height should be the diameter of the circle. That is the law. Make the fire circle. You will slowly start feeling the heat and it will increase within half an hour. Then just see what is going on in your skin. In two days you will master. Wow, both will not be painful.\n\nThen come to the next level of experiment. When you are feeling unpleasant just see. Unpleasantness is nothing but cold or warm which is working from inside the skin. If you look near the chest area it starts from inside the skin, the skin is being attacked. Warm and cold, heat and cold attacks you from outside the skin, unpleasantness and pleasantness attacks you from inside the skin. Sit with that. You don't need to find the situation. Already you have enough unpleasantness! Just sit with that unpleasantness. How it is attacking you from inside skin? What exactly you are feeling without looking, just see. In two days you will realize there is no such thing as unpleasantness other than your own decision to be in unpleasantness.  Same way pleasantness, when you are in joy, happy, just sit and watch, what is this, what is this pleasantness, why it feels so expanded inside? Feel from your skin, inside the skin. You will master that state also.\n\nSo pleasant or unpleasant attacks you from inside the skin; heat or cold attacks you from outside skin. But both heat or cold; pleasantness or unpleasantness; all 4 has no life independently from your will.  Understanding this is being centered on the Supreme state. Please understand, your will gets contaminated when it connects itself with these 4. Fortunately these 4 have no independent existence if your will does not support it. Man who has realized it by experimenting with it is established in Supreme state.  He is called Paramatma Samahita - equivalent to the Supreme consciousness. \n\nSuch a simple, straightforward   thing, I tell you!  Just try today.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k9yFPraUaSg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCUa30fqKOxNHan0FM2HPrmyWgEdQ","youtubeID":"k9yFPraUaSg","viewCount":4842,"eventDate":"2012-09-15","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"master-heat-and-cold-k9yfprauasg"}}
