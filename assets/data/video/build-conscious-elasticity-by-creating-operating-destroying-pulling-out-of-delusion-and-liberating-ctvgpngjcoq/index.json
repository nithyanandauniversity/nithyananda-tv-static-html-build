SO I PRAY TO BHAGAVAN SRI AUROBINDO TO BLESS ALL OF US ON HIS AVATARA DINA.\n\n*IT IS AUROBINDO’S VISION FOR WHAT HE ASPIRED, THAT WE MADE INTO REALITY AS KAILASA WITH HIS BLESSINGS! LET US ALL BOW DOWN TO BHAGAVAN SRI AUROBINDO.\n\n*TODAY ALSO IS THE INDEPENDENCE DAY OF INDIA. MYSELF PERSONALLY AND ON BEHALF OF KAILASA, I PRAY TO PARAMASHIVA: LET INDIA AND INDIANS BE SHOWERED WITH ALL THE BLESSINGS AND ALL THE AUSPICIOUSNESS.\n\n*LET PARAMASHIVA BLESS BHARAT!\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM KAILASA:\n\n*IN EVERY LEVEL, I FOLLOW VYAKARANA AND SANSKRIT GRAMMAR STRUCTURE, PANINI. THERE ARE FEW MORE GRAMMARIANS, BUT PANINI IS THE TOP. \n*I HAVE GIVEN 6 POINTS IN MY FACEBOOK PAGE (http://tinyurl.com/swamiji-grammar), TO EXPLAIN HOW THE SANSKRIT BASED THINKING AND SANSKRIT GRAMMAR FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR THINKING MECHANISM, EVEN THOUGH YOU USE VOCABULARY OF OTHER LANGUAGES.\n\n*MY THINKING MECHANISM FUNCTIONS SANSKRIT BASED, WHETHER I USE ENGLISH WORDS OR TAMIL WORDS. THE GRAMMAR STRUCTURE VYAKARANA, WHICH FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF MY THINKING AND EXPLAINING, EXPRESSING, IS FROM SANSKRIT ROOT.\n\n*IN A WAY, IT IS NON-THINKING, NOT EVEN THINKING.\n\n*IT IS THE MAPPING OF THE COSMIC PRINCIPLES INTO THE LANGUAGE HUMAN BEINGS CAN INTERNALIZE. THAT GRAMMAR IS SANSKRIT BASED.\n\n*IF YOU READ THIS, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW I AM EXPLAINING THE PRINCIPLES AND MAPPING THE COSMIC PRINCIPLES INTO THE LANGUAGE THAT MODERN MEN CAN UNDERSTAND.\n\n*TO UNDERSTAND THE SATSANGS, IT WILL BE GOOD IF YOU KNOW THE GRAMMAR WITH WHICH I AM OPERATING.\n\n*SO I SINCERELY REQUEST: AT LEAST REGULAR SATSANGIS, DEVOTEES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ATTEND SATSANGS REGULARLY KEEPING ENLIGHTENMENT AS FIRST PRIORITY, LEARN AT LEAST A LITTLE SANSKRIT. IT WILL HELP YOU.\n\n*TODAY’S MESSAGE: CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY. 1) IT IS POSSIBLE 2) IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT CONSCIOUSLY 3) HUMAN BRAIN IS HARDWIRED FOR IT\n\n*VISUALISE THIS EXAMPLE I AM GIVING: PARAMASHIVA WITH 25 PHASES/FACES.\n\n*THE PHASES OF COSMOS ONLY BECOME FACES OF PARAMASHIVA, LIKE CREATION OF CREATION PRINCIPLE, CREATION OF SUSTENANCE PRINCIPLE, CREATION OF REJUVENATION PRINCIPLE, CREATION OF PULLING OUT OF DELUSION PRINCIPLE, CREATION OF LIBERATION PRINCIPLE.\n\n*MAINTENANCE OF CREATION PRINCIPLE, MAINTENANCE OF MAINTENANCE PRINCIPLE, MAINTENANCE OF REJUVENATION PRINCIPLE, MAINTENANCE OF PULLING OUT OF DELUSION PRINCIPLE, MAINTENANCE OF LIBERATION PRINCIPLE.\n\n*REJUVENATION OF CREATION PRINCIPLE, REJUVENATION OF MAINTENANCE PRINCIPLE, REJUVENATION OF REJUVENATION PRINCIPLE, REJUVENATION OF PULLING OUT OF DELUSION PRINCIPLE, REJUVENATION OF LIBERATION PRINCIPLE.\n\n*DELUDING CREATION PRINCIPLE, DELUDING MAINTENANCE PRINCIPLE, DELUDING REJUVENATION PRINCIPLE, DELUDING DELUDING PRINCIPLE, DELUDING LIBERATION PRINCIPLES.\n\n*LIBERATING CREATION PRINCIPLE, LIBERATING MAINTENANCE PRINCIPLE, LIBERATING REJUVENATION PRINCIPLE, LIBERATING DELUSION PRINCIPLE, LIBERATION OF LIBERATION PRINCIPLE.\n\n*THESE ARE THE 25 PHASES AND FACES OF PARAMASHIVA: SRISHTI, STITHI, SAMHARA, TROBHAVA, ANUGRAHA - CREATION, SUSTENANCE, REJUVENATION, PULLING OUT OF DELUSION, LIBERATION. ALL THESE FIVE, FORMING PERMUTATION COMBINATION WITH ONE ANOTHER FORMS 25. THAT 25 IS THE PHASES AND FACES OF PARAMASHIVA.\n\n*IF YOU HAVE 25 HEADS, YOUR CONSCIOUS ABILITY TO SYNCH ALL THE 25 AND KEEP YOURSELF INTEGRATED AND KEEP ALL 25 UNDER YOUR CONTROL IS WHAT I CALL CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY.\n\n*IF YOU HAVE 25 HEADS, YOU NEED A VERY STRONG NECK MUSCLE. IF YOU HAVE JATAS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY YOU NEED A STRONG NECK MUSCLE. LONG HAIR HAS MULTIPLE IMPLICATIONS IN DEVELOPING CONSCIOUS ELASTICITY - SAHAJA SAMADHI.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA EXPLAINS IN CHARYA AND YOGA PADA THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG JATA. ALL ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS WHICH PREPARED HUMAN BEINGS FOR DIVINE ENCOUNTER HAD LONG JATA AS THEIR HAIRSTYLE. SHORT HAIR IS STUPID MAN’S HAIRSTYLE MADE POPULAR IN MODERN DAY. ALL ANCIENT CIVILIZATION - AFRICAN, MAYAN AGE. WE HAVE EVIDENCES FOR 49 CIVILIZATIONS THAT WERE THERE. BUT ONLY THE HINDU CIVILIZATION IS SURVIVING UNBROKEN, EVEN THOUGH BRUTAL ATTACKS- - PHYSICALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT IS STILL SURVIVING.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4230450253709459","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/CtvgpNGjCoQ/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"CtvgpNGjCoQ","viewCount":2856,"eventDate":"2020-08-15","duration":4881,"likeCount":91,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"build-conscious-elasticity-by-creating-operating-destroying-pulling-out-of-delusion-and-liberating-ctvgpngjcoq"}}
