In this clip taken from the discourses titled, \"The Power of no Judging & Detach Naturally\", Swamiji teaches us deep truths about the vedic tradition.  He tells us that in Vedic tradition we do not teach any set of rules or dogma.  In this tradition children are first initiated into Gayathri where they are told to meditate on superconciousness.  The student is given a torch in the form of meditation and encouraged to explore on his own.    He goes on to teach us that only the tradition or religion discovered by us will expand our being and give us joy.  Swamiji goes on to expound on Mahadeva's sutra and tells us that when Shiva is telling us to drop even the Masters' form, it means we should drop everything and then only drop the Master.  Often peopleuse this sutra conveniently to drop the master as and when they can or when the master starts his spiritual surgery on the disciple.
