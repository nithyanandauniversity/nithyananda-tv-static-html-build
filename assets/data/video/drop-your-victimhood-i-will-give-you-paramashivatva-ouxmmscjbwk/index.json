THEN THE REAL GOAL WILL APPEAR IN YOUR INNER SPACE!\n\n*SACRIFICING PLEASURE IS VERY EASY. SACRIFICING YOUR GUILT, PAIN, THE FEELING YOU ARE NOT COMPETENT, THE FEELING OF FAILURE, IS THE REAL TYAGA!\n\n*WHEN THERE IS AN ATTACK ON YOU, NATURALLY YOU WILL HAVE SOME POINT WHERE YOU MISSED IN THE WAR. NO ONE CAN BE COMPLETELY COMPLETELY PERFECT. KRISHNA MISSED MANY THINGS IN THE WAR! HE MISSED ABHIMANYU. END OF THE DAY HE CAN JUSTIFY ANYTHING HE WANTS, BUT EVERY LOSS, WHETHER ABHIMANYU OR THE PANCHA PANDAVAS’ SONS, THEY WERE LOST BECAUSE KRISHNA MISSED IT! HE IS ALSO FUNCTIONING BETWEEN CERTAIN FRAMES! THE POWER OF ARJUNA’S ENERGY IS UNDENIABLE, NO DOUBT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CANNOT COMPLETELY LEAVE KARNA’S TAPAS, ASHWATHAMA’S TAPAS. HE HAS TO GIVE SOME BALI DANA. HE HAS TO KILL SOME PEOPLE. HE ONLY CHOSE WHO SHOULD BE PROTECTED COMPLETELY AND WHO CAN BE GIVEN AWAY BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.\n\n*EVEN IN YOUR LIFE, THE WAR CAN NEVER BE PERFECT. SACRIFICING THE PAIN THAT IS CREATED INSIDE YOU BY YOU FEELING THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INTELLIGENT AND MISSED IT, IS TYAGA!\n\n*ALL WARS SHOULD BE AVOIDED FOR THE LARGER GOOD OF THE HUMANITY. BUT IF WAR IS FORCED ON YOU, YOU SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR ,YOU WILL NEVER BE A PERFECT STRATEGIST. YOU MIGHT HAVE WON THE WAR, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE A PERFECT STRATEGIST. THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO PLACES THAT YOU WILL REPENT LATER ON THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER. YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE THAT FEELING.\n\n*THE PAST IS NOT DEAD AND GONE AS YOU THINK. THE FUTURE IS NOT UNBORN AS YOU THINK. FROM THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE, YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT. IN THE PAST THERE WERE 1000 GOOD AND 1000 BAD THINGS. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE 1000 GOOD THINGS AND FEEL EMPOWERED AND ENERGISED OR LOOK AT THE 1000 BAD THINGS AND BEAT YOURSELF WITH PAIN, GUILT AND SUFFERING.\n\n*IN THE FUTURE, THERE ARE GOING TO BE 1000 GOOD THINGS AND 1000 BAD THINGS. YOU CAN DECIDE TO MANIFEST ALL THOSE 1000 GOOD THINGS AND KEEP YOURSELF BUSY WITH IT AND LIVE A GREAT LIFE OF PARAMASHIVATVA, OR THINK OF THE 1000 BAD THINGS LIKE YOUR PEN BROKEN, YOUR CAR TYRE GETTING PUNCTURED OR SEEING A RED SIGNAL WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING TO THE LOTTERY TO DEPOSIT THE TICKET AND RECEIVE THE MONEY. YOU CAN COLLAPSE THINKING OF THESE. IT IS YOUR CHOICE!\n\n*YOU HAVE FULL FREEDOM TO CREATE THE OPINION ABOUT THE PAST AND TO CREATE THE POSSIBILITY OF YOUR FUTURE. THIS CLARITY YOU WILL GET ONLY IF YOU DECIDE TO DO TYAGA.\n\n*I AM FREED AND LIBERATED FROM SUFFERINGS ONCE AND FOR ALL, RELATED TO THE PAST AND FUTURE, BECAUSE I DECIDED TO DO TYAGA.\n\n*YOU CAN ALWAYS SACRIFICE THE ACHIEVEMENTS, PLEASANTNESS, BLISS, RELATED TO THE PAST. YOU CAN ALWAYS FORGET THAT YOU DID A PHD. BUT YOU CAN NEVER FORGET YOU GOT DELAYED IN ONE EXAMINATION BECAUSE YOU SLEPT OR BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND. YOU WILL CARRY THAT PAIN EVEN NOW. SACRIFICING PAST-RELATED PAINS AND UNDERSTANDING EVEN FACTUALLY THAT MANY OF YOUR PAINS ARE UNJUSTIFIED AND INCORRECT, AND THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY REALITY, BY THE REAL HAPPENING, IS ‘COMPLETION’.\n\n*EVEN FACTUALLY, AS PER THE REAL HAPPENING, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED FROM ALL DIMENSIONS, YOUR PAINS ARE NOT JUSTIFIED. THEY ARE NOT REALLY REALLY RIGHT TO EXIST IN YOU. UNDERSTANDING THIS IS COMPLETION WITH THE PAST. EVEN IF YOU HAVE PAINS WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY JUSTIFIED, AND YOU MAYBE KAIKEYI OR SHURPANAKA, YOU ARE WRONG!\n\n*DOING TYAGA OF THE FALSE IDEA THAT MANY WRONG THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE TO YOU, IS THE REAL TYAGA. ONLY IF YOU HAVE DONE THE SACRIFICE OF YOUR PAIN AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR YOUR PAIN, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IN THE PAST YOU EXISTED AS PARAMASHIVA AND YOU WILL GET THE CONFIDENCE THAT IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN MANIFEST PARAMASHIVA! THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH.\n\n*THERE WILL BE A GAP BETWEEN WHAT I AM SAYING AND WHAT YOU THINK AS REALITY. SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY, ‘NO SWAMIJI, MY PAIN IS JUSTIFIED!’","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/OUXMMSCjbwk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"OUXMMSCjbwk","viewCount":5596,"eventDate":"2020-03-02","duration":6322,"likeCount":237,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"drop-your-victimhood-i-will-give-you-paramashivatva-ouxmmscjbwk"}}
