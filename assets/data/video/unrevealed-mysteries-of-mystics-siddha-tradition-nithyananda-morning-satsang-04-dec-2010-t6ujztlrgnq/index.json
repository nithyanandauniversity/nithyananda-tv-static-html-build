The unrevealed should not just disappear without being revealed to the world. Human consciousness should experience the Super Consciousness. This is done by Incarnations.\nYesterday he expressed some great truths about death. Today, he gave an example of how our bodies are like mirrors that forget to reflect back to the source, Sun, but instead project out to the world. Some things in the world are liked by the self, others rejected. This causes all our problems.  \nThe reflection, instead of looking at things it is reflecting onto (the ordinary life), should look back to the source. So many on the planet have life but don't know what to do with it -  too much choice without having choice-less awareness. If he is asked to kill any one state on planet, this is it: too much choice without choice-less awareness. \nWe all have 72,000 minor nadis (energy channels) in body, 12 major ones, and one central, this is the Siddha science. Say you are attracted to food, one of your nadis will be engaged in this. If you are afraid of something, one nadi is used to keep that file. If you use too many nadis this way, you are caught in what you are seeing. If instead you  turn yourself to the source, from where you are reflecting, you have an enlightened life. \nModern day kids suffer from this, which causes depression, drugs, and a loss of childhood and joy. Indian kids especially have lost their roots. He warned Indian Youth, getting back to the Vedic lifestyle is not an option, it is a medicine for them. This is the only remedy for Indian Youth. He doesn't mean drop their jeans, iPods and cellphones, but to put the culture back into their lives.  But living with too many choices without choiceless awareness is a dangerous idea. \nIn the 72,000 nadis, if at least 10,000 are reflecting back to source, you will be balanced. So one hour daily be centered on higher ideals, the source from which you are reflecting. Or just perish. Indian youth are largest number in world. India has the largest young population. If they perish it is dangerous for the world. That is why he assumed the body of Indian youth, they are his first priority. \nThis balance is the essence of life. Physically you will then express miracles. The reflection can change the mirror, your body, if more nadis are turned inward, instead of outward.\nHe is completely free on which he is reflecting. All 72,000 nadis reflect back to the source from which he is reflecting. He can make time out of consciousness. And he has enough to make not hundreds, but thousands of years. He will talk later about retrieving nadi flow to heal body, change body, heal body, and enjoy being in the body in next session.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
