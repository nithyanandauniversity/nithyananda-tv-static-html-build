In this profound delivery of the Isha Upanishad, Verse I, Paramahamsa Nithyananda declares how his goal is to lead us to higher reality.\nLife is all about evolving our cognition from perception to fact, fact to truth and truth to reality. That’s all. Nothing to do with so-called bliss, love, renunciation and yoga; all these are side effects. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\nLet me enter into the mantra.\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥\nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nThe translation is:\n \n“By the Consciousness filled must this all be,\nWhatever moving thing there is in the ever-moving world.\nWith this renounced, you may enjoy.\nCovet not the wealth of anyone at all.\n \nListen!  Yesterday I was expanding these four words.  I will expand those four words a little more deep, and then move to the next.  Listen!\n \n· PERCEPTION: Whatever your senses can perceive in a limited Time and Space.\n \n· Second, FACT: Your senses perceiving with more Time and Space.\n \n· TRUTH: With a lot more Time and Space, even your perception evolves.  Truth!\n \n· REALITY is: Existence as it is, beyond your perception and Time and Space.\n \nYesterday I was giving an example:\n \n·  PERCEPTION: Earth is flat.  Sun is going around the Earth.\n \n·  FACT: No!  Earth is round, and Earth only is going around the Sun.\n \n·  TRUTH: Earth is not exactly round; it is more like an Orange fruit – a little pressed above and below.  And Sun goes around the Earth. \n \nPlease listen!  In the Perception also, you felt that Sun goes around the Earth.  In Truth also, Sun goes around the Earth.  But, both are not one and the same.  Here you know it with a clear understanding that the Sun goes around the Earth in a few billion years because this whole Sun family is not stagnant, the whole Sun family is moving around, the whole Solar System is moving around centred on something.  So, in that way, Sun will go around the Earth at least once in billions of years.\n \n·         The REALITY is: The shape of the Earth should be seen with the Google Earth map.  You cannot describe it as round, or a little Orange fruit type.  No!  No description is possible.  See it as it is.  And, both Sun and the Earth are going around each other.  Earth goes around within one year period; Sun goes around within a few billion years. \n \nListen!  Life is all about evolving your cognition from Perception to Fact, Fact to Truth, Truth to Reality, that’s all!  It has nothing to do with so-called Bliss, Love, Renunciation, Devotion, Yoga, nothing.  All these are side-effects. \n \nWhen your Perception evolves to Fact, you may suddenly become meditative, you may suddenly become yogic, you may suddenly become loving, you may suddenly become blissful; but, life itself, the purpose of life itself is to evolve from Perception to Fact, Fact to Truth, Truth to Reality. \n \nWhen you are moving from Fact to Truth, you may suddenly become active, you may suddenly become more loving, you may suddenly become blissful, you may suddenly lose your cunningness.  I am seeing that happening, after I started the Upanishads, in so many people!  People are losing their hypocrisy; people are losing their anger, violence. \n \nThe highest form of violence is, you deciding you will not be useful or productive to anybody.  That is the highest form of violence.  You deciding, ‘I will not be useful!’  See, when you are angry towards your boss – ‘I will not be useful to his aim, his goal.’  Same way, only when you are angry with yourself and Sangha, Guru, whatever you see....  See, when you are angry with yourself, you will be angry with everything, everybody, every one.  Only then you will decide, ‘I will not be useful’, or, ‘I will not make any of their declarations into reality.’\n \n“Love” means, making yourself as a catalyst for everyone’s reality.  “Nothing more can be done!” – to THAT extent!  Not only you should perceive “whatever you can you have done”, but everyone also should feel “whatever you can, you have done it for making everyone’s reality”.  That is what is “Love”. \nFull Transcrit Link:- video/purpose-life-evolve","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ubMhCmL3FX0/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ubMhCmL3FX0","viewCount":9654,"eventDate":"2015-01-31","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"purpose-of-life-is-to-evolve-ubmhcml3fx0"}}
