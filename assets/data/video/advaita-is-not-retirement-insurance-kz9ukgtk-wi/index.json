If we don't use Advaita now as a tool for our strategy planning, we will have to leave the body before a chance to enjoy the non-dual space happens. Why miss out on the experience of real love and enlightenment? We need not practice some elaborate techniques to experience Advaita now. With the powerful practice of Advaita and completion with our teamilies, we can experience the non-dual space today. \n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\nToday I am coming back to the subject of Teamily.  I almost gave you guys a few days' time, last few days' time to complete with all the teamily members.  So, before tomorrow morning, you will finish all the Completions with all your teamily members.  And, tomorrow morning, I expect all of you to be ready for the next process.  Understand, today, all of you with your teamily members should have Complete Completion.  You should sit with them, sort out all the completions; either both of you should have understood your incompletions are foolishness, and drop them, or you should have understood your incompletions are reasonless. \n\nPlease understand, sometimes by logically analyzing you can understand your incompletions are logic-less; sometimes you can understand it is foolishness.  Whether it is logical or not, you don't need to spend time on it digging it out; you don't need to spend time analyzing your garbage; that is the job of the Municipality.  You can just dump. \n\nSo, understand, come to the Completion by today.  By today evening you should have finished all the Completion.  Night, go to bed in the space of Complete Completion.  And, tomorrow morning be here for the next step of process.     \n\nPlease understand, take this process really, really, really seriously and sincerely.  Do it very authentically.  All the Shrimahants...see, I have not seen the Shrimahants' teamily list.  And all the Mahants, many I have seen, a few I have not seen.  And Kotharis, almost 80% sent; I think 20% still missing.  Thanedars, I think only 40% Thanedars sent.  Please understand, let us take it very seriously, because, all your teamily put together is my teamily.  Understand one thing: my teamily consists of grahas (planets), pancha bhootas (the five elements)!  When you form a teamily and create Advaithic space with them, you become part of my teamily.  So, naturally, all my teamily will be in Advaitha with you!  I know you cannot understand; that is why.  It is a little difficult for you to understand.  But, I will make you understand.  Let us come to the clear Advaithic space.\n\nPlease understand, only when the incompletions are removed, I can lead you to the next level of the positive non-dual space.  In the positive non-dual space, so much of fulfilment, so much of fulfilment happens, so much of clarity happens, so much of......  Please understand, whatever you want to create as reality happens, whatever the other person wants to create as reality happens; simply you cause their reality and they cause your reality.  I really, really wanted the whole Sangha to experience the Complete Completion with their teamily today. \n\nSo, today, tonight is the last time.  Till night you can send your teamily list, you can file your nomination papers for getting elected as part of the Cosmic Teamily.  All the twenty-one people who are going to be selected will be given the title \"Secretary of Swamiji\", \"Secretary of His Holiness\".  This is completely separate from the titles you have -- Mahant, Shrimahant, all that.  So, you will be given a straight title -- \"Secretary to His Holiness\".  So, get ready!  But the basic qualification is, Advaitha should become experience in you, it should become experience in you.  The rustic, raw, ground-level truth should be your basic cognition.  Understand, the rustic truth of life is non-duality.  The raw truth of life is Advaitha.  It should become your basic cognition in whatever you do, in whatever you live, in whatever you touch, in whatever you handle, in whatever you see. \n\nCome to the truth, come to the clarity, whoever may be in your teamily -- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,  whatever -- please understand, your Completion with them or incompletion with them, they are not responsible for that.  Irrespective of them, you develop a pattern of incompletion with somebody else, somewhere else, and bring it and keep it on this teamily.  See, whether you keep a gunny bag on them or a silk shawl on them, you will be somewhere else, the poor fellow standing in front of you is in no way responsible for the gunny bag or silk shawl you are dumping on them.\n\nSo, understand, Advaitha Sathya is the only truth.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kz9uKGTK-WI/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"kz9uKGTK-WI","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"advaita-is-not-retirement-insurance-kz9ukgtk-wi"}}
