NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND. FRANCE, SLOVENIA, SWEDEN, UNITED KINGDOM, UNITED STATES\n*DEEPAVALI NEIVEDYAM OFFERINGS: 2213\n\nMY BLESSINGS TO ALL THESE KAILASAS. \n*AS THE LIVING REPRESENTATIVE OF PARAMASHIVA I ACCEPT ALL THE OFFERINGS AND BLESS YOU ALL.\n*LET THESE OFFERINGS DONE BE DISTRIBUTED AS PRASADAM TO ALL. IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND HAS ALL BECOME PRASADAM. PLEASE DISTRIBUTE TO ALL DEVOTEES AND EVERYONE WHO HAS COME TO CELEBRATE DEEPAVALI.\n*ON THIS AUSPICIOUS DEEPAVALI DAY, WE HAVE A VERY BEAUTIFUL ANNOUNCEMENT - THE HINDU VOTES ARE SACRED - THE HINDU VOTES MATTER - HINDUS VOTE FOR HINDUISM ACTIVITY, IS GETTING CONSOLIDATED AND PRESENTED TO ALL OF YOU! \n*THIS VOTING SYSTEM IN HINDUISM IS THERE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL. EVEN IN THE VEDAS AND PURANAS, THERE IS A REFERENCE WHERE A CONCEPT IS DEBATED AND VOTED. \n*EVEN IN PURANAS, THERE ARE ENOUGH HISTORICAL REFERENCE. FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THIS IS THERE - DOING VAKYARTHASADAS, JEEVARTHASADAS AND ANUBHAVA MANTAPA - DISCUSSION - AND VOTING FOR CERTAIN CONCEPTS, IDEAS DECISIONS TO COME TO CONCLUSION. \n*THE SAME TRADITION HAS BEEN HANDED OVER TO ME FROM  MY GURU PARAMPARA AND I HAVE REVIVED IT. \n*FROM THE LAST 26 YEARS OF MY LIFE, WE ARE PRESENTING THE HINDU PRAMILAMENT SYSTEM. \n*I USED TO PRESENT MANY CONCEPTS IN MY SATSANGS AND PROGRAMS AND ASK PEOPLE TO RAISE THEIR HANDS AND I WILL ALWAYS EXPLAIN THE OTHER SIDE AND ASK, “WHOEVER UNDERSTANDS THIS PRINCIPE RAISE YOUR HAND.” \n*FROM THE ANCIENT SYSTEM I WAS REVIVING THE ORIGINAL PARLIAMENT SYSTEM AS REVEALED IN THE TREATISE ON THE NATARAJA TEMPLE IN CHIDAMBARAM WHICH IS THE ONLY SURVIVING HINDU SABHA HALL FROM ANCIENT DAYS - WHICH CONSTITUTES THE CHIT SABHA, RAJA SABHA, KANAKA SAHBHA, DEVA SABHA AND NRITTA SABHA.\n*REPORT FROM THE CHIT SABHA PROCEEDINGS ON - PURE VEGETARIANISM.\nTOTAL HINDU VOTES ON VEGETARIANISM CUMULATIVE CHART FROM YEAR 2004 TO 2018. \nTOTAL CUMULATIVE VOTES ON VEGETARIANISM IS 120 MILLION VOTES.\n*THE PRINCIPLES OF HINDU DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM:\nhttps://kailasapedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Parliament\n*TODAY I AM PRESENTING ALL THE 26 YEARS YEARS OF WORK WE HAVE DONE IN MULTILEVEL ON HINDU VOTING. THE WHOLE THING IS ALREADY UPLOADED IN NITHYANANDA PEDIA. THE MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THE VOTING WAS DONE AND RESULTS DOCUMENTED IS THERE. FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE VIDEOGRAPHED AND PHOTOGRAPHED FROM 2000 SO WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND ITS VALIDITY.\n*TODAY I AM PRESENTING THE HINDU VOTES ON VEGETARIANISM. NOW WE HAVE STARTED DOING EVERYTHING DIGITALLY, OPENING THE WHOLE VAKYARTHASADAS AND JEEVARTHASADAS - PARLIAMENTARY VOTING - TO THE WHOLE WORLD, TO ALL HINDUS. \n*OUT OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED, 46.7 % ARE BORN AND PRACTISING HINDUS. 34.9% ARE BORN BUT NOT PRACTISING HINDUS. 14.1% ARE PRACTISING BUT NOT BORN HINDUS. AND 4.3 % ARE NON HINDUS. \n*WE ASKED PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR WHETHER NON VEG FOOD SHOULD BE COMPLETELY STOPPED OR ALLOWED FOR HINDUS OR ALLOWED ONLY RITUALISTICALLY. \n*RESULTS OF HINDUS FIRST VOTE:\n*OVERWHELMINGLY, 74.2 % PEOPLE VOTED FOR NON VEGETARIAN FOOD TO BE COMPLETELY STOPPED! 14.4 % VOTED THAT IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED REGULARLY. 11.3% VOTED THAT IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED RITUALISTICALLY.\n*BASED ON THE VAKYARTHASADAS THAT HAPPENED AND THE VOTING THAT HAPPENED FOR LAST FEW DAYS DIGITALLY AND THE EARLIER WORK DONE, EVERYTHING PUT TOGETHER, FINALLY WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION.\n*AS THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM AND JAGATGURU MAHASANNIDHANAM OF HINDUISM, KAILASA DECLARES ALL HINDUS WILL DROP NONVEGETARIAN FOOD ONCE AND FOR ALL. \n*SO HINDU WHO WANTS TO PRACTISE HINDUISM WILL DROP NONVEGETARIAN FOOD ONCE AND FOR ALL. \n\n*SO NONVEGETARIAN IS NISHEDHA, EQUIVALENT TO THE FATWA OF ISLAM. VIDHI AND NISHEDHA ARE THE WORDS IN HINDUISM FOR “RULE”. VEG LIFESTYLE BECOME RULE AND NON-VEG FOOD IS NISHEDHA - BANNED. THE FATWA FOR HINDUS IS ISSUED: FROM TODAY ALL THE PRACTISING HINDUS WILL DROP NONVEGETARIAN FOOD COMPLETELY.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4576550199099461\n\n\n\nGet Your Free E-Passport at join.kailaasa.org and receive all the gifts to live enlightenment!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LmWD7l9tAg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAagsOWqGi6mNoglrw2MAt2hVjZEA","youtubeID":"4LmWD7l9tAg","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"special-deepavali-message-from-the-supreme-pontiff-of-hinduism-oror-14-nov-2020-4lmwd7l9tag"}}
