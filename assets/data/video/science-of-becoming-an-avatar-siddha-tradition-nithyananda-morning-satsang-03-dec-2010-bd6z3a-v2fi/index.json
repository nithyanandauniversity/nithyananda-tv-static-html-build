All other traditions end with enlightenment. Only the Siddhas go one step further and talk about radiating enlightenment and creating the experience in others. No other tradition has done so much research on the body.  All the others stop with awakening the non-mechanical parts of the brain. The Siddha Tradition goes one step further; awakening DNA and making new man.\nThe Siddha Tradition is not separate from the Vedic Tradition; it is a small, mystical group within it.  They learned to use the 'deaths' we experience as part of life, as a tool to awaken our dormant DNA.  For instance, when you become disillusioned with society, it creates deep insecurity within you. From here you have two choices, you can break apart or have the third strand of DNA awakened in you (most people only have 2 of their 12 strands of DNA active).\nWhen that insecurity awakens in you, just go into that death. From there you will live in a more conscious state.  Similarly, if you have a broken heart from a failed relationship, that 'death' will awaken DNA and you can become a Brahmacharie, create a new life and new body.  Each of these deaths, disappointments in life, is an opportunity to awaken DNA and get closer to being an avatar.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda gave several wonderful, entertaining examples from his childhood which show the 'death' he experienced, and the resulting consciousness that followed.  The Siddhas actually used death as a tool. He told the inner awakening participants that today they would work on death, not to the extremes of the Siddhas, but to use the technique to awaken their DNA.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium. He has inspired over 4 million lives worldwide to a new conscious age of enlightened living and has healed many thousands from chronic diseases and mental problems & traumas. The most watched and most popular spiritual teacher on Youtube globally with over 7000 hours of discourses, he has dedicated his life and the spiritual mission with over 1200 full-time volunteers to teach the science of enlightenment. \n\nHis spiritual teachings, life solutions and meditation workshops are the extraordinary works of a Spiritual Genius. 'Inner Awakening' is his ultimate offering to create a New Man - a 21 days enlightenment intensive program for a permanent breakthrough in consciousness and to experience living enlightenment, a conflict-free life. Thousands from around the planet are experiencing their Inner Awakening with total physical wellbeing, deep emotional healing, release from past life traumas, DNA reprogramming and actualizing their limitless potential by transcending into a zone of bliss.
