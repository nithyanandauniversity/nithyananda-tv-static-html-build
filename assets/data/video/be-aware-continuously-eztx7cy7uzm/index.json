In this clip taken from discourse titled, The Power of Sensitivity, Swamiji tells us that Shiva is now giving techniques for those of us who cannot find the time to meditate!  These sutras from Shiva are from the non-technique zone.  In this sutra Shiva is trying to change our being without doing.  In this technique all you need to do is to remember, You Are  in whatever you do.  Shiva is teaching us to be aware continuously.  Swamiji tells us that if we are surprised by the incidents happening in our lives, it means we are in deep slumber!  If you are living in self-remembrance, you will always be moral and ethical.
