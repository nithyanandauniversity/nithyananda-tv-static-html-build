This translates to \"these great vows - ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (living like God) and aparigrahah (living with minimal) are universal truths; not conditioned, not restricted by birth or species, place or time, circumstances or situations - beyond all these, these 5 vows are universal.\"\n\nGlorifying Patanjali's infinite qualities, Rare Avatar and Enlightened Master, Nithyananda shared, \"This one sutra puts Patanjali beyond comprehension because he is normally represented always as a person who taught us how to stretch the body, blow the nose and reach enlightenment. But, in this sutra, he proves that he is not just spiritual, but he also brought understanding into the social life.\" Continuing to reveal Patanjali, the father of Yoga more deeply, Swamiji added that \"Patanjali has done amazing research and made the world's largest grammar book. His maha bhasya on sanskrit on 'Paanini Sutras' is not just for Sanskrit, but for all languages. For body, he created Ayurveda, for vaak (energy that converts to speech), he created maha bhaashya and for body, he created Patanjali Yoga Sutras.\"\n\nIn this sutra Patanjali explained - \"The How, Why and What of Laws\" - The Law of Making Laws. Swamiji said, \" This one sutra is enough to give base for all the country law makers. If they can understand this one sutra, they may not even use the law -- their whole country will become enlightened!\"\n\nThe essence of this sutra as dealt in-depth by Nithyananda, \"All the conditionings of human beings from which they suffer, are of 4 categories - Jaati (birth), Desha (place), Kaala (time), Samaya (situation). And whenever you go to the source of the law - analyzing it with the 4 conditionings, you are liberated by the law and from the law. Each law that tortures you, take that and analyze with these 4 -- you will be liberated from that law!\n\nThat is why Patanjali says \"Sarva bhoumya\". These principals exist universally beyond the 4 conditionings -- which jaati you are born, what is your parental conditioning, what is the time, the situation -- no bar -- these 5 still has to be lived. Not as a law or rule. These 5 can be lived only when you realize this 5 is wealth to you. To realize this, you need to be awakened, conscious and enlightened. Patanjali says all these 5 are not a law. It is the law and energy that enforces the law -- both are called the yama. Go to the source of law from where it comes you will experience the energy from where it comes. Whenever you go to source of law you are liberated by the law and from the law.\n \nIf these 4 conditions are removed from you -- the birth, place, time and situation are removed from you only pure consciousness remains in you. So these 5 -- ahimsa, asteya, satya, aparigraha, brahmacharya are wealth stored in your consciousness. When you live Yama (law) then you don't have Yama -- death!\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BIThR8hRXhk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDgZzR0CBF4UUSTHDa4g9ijXa2UWQ","youtubeID":"BIThR8hRXhk","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"35"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"ashtanga-yoga-yama-3-patanjali-yoga-sutras-82-nithyananda-morning-satsang-14-dec-2010-bithr8hrxhk"}}
