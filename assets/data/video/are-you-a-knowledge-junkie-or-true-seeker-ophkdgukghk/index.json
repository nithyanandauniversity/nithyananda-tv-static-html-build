Paramahamsa Nithyananda enters into verse 10, intercepting into the most subtle spiritual difficulties the advanced seekers face in seeking. He speaks to those, whose sincere goal of Life is Samadhi, Enlightenment. He first explains, who is not a seeker – the knowledge junkies who just collect, chew books, for time pass and discussions over dinner table, are not seekers. In real seeking, the time never passes; we only gain time, depth, strength. In the Ultimate Samadhi, Ultimate truth, there is no compromise. Such an intense seeking goes to the very bone marrow, never loses focus, and goes with powerful Tapas (penance), which means living and executing the Truths you discovered till now.\n\nIsha Upanishad – Verse 10\nanyad evāhur vidyayā-anyad āhur avidyayā |\niti śuśruma dhīrāṇaṁ ye nastad vicacakṣire || 10 ||\n\nToday’s Vakyartha Sadas, topic for spiritual explorations on Truth is — “All the cognitions I have achieved, conclusions I have arrived, have I made that as my day-to-day lifestyle practise. All the conclusions I have arrived, have I made that as part of my Life. What all the truths I understood, I have made them as part of my Life. What all the truths I have understood, I have not made it as part of my Life. Look into that. That is the subject for Vakyartha Sadas today.”","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ophKdGUKGhk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ophKdGUKGhk","viewCount":3053,"eventDate":"2015-04-25","duration":1487,"likeCount":90,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-you-a-knowledge-junkie-or-true-seeker-ophkdgukghk"}}
