This peace invocation chant is a declaration from the Upanishad Rishis that enriches us with the power of will. Vedic tradition is witness to the Rishis, the courageous saints whose power of declaration could not deny them the response from Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Sadashiva. Their declaration, which is the 'power of will' manifested Sadashiva Himself in front of them, reveals His Holiness. \nHuman beings should be taught this technology, ability to invoke any thought current we want which makes life blissful, joyful, peaceful.  \n\"\"Awaken the power of WILL. You will understand whole Universe is your own. Whole universe is your friend. When you declare and integrate your being, the kind of a power you radiate, the kind of a knowledge you shower on yourself and others, the kind of an energy you experience as Life is extraordinary.\"\"\nEntering deeper into the Shanti Mantra pada, He explains: \n\"\" Sarvam brahmopniṣadam – All is Brahman, Consciousness that is revealed in the Upaniṣads. All is Consciousness. Everything is from and is established, exists and goes back to the Consciousness. \nmāham brahma nirākuryām  – May I never deny the existence of Brahman. Let this high energy always be in me, where my confidence, my trust is maintained. May I never have incompletion with Brahman, Consciousness. \nmā mā brahma nirākarod  – May Brahman never deny me or withdraw Its grace from me.  \nanirākaraṇam astu anirākaraṇam me astu - Let there be no separation from Brahman; Let me have Completion with Brahman, the Consciousness; and let Brahman be complete with me. So be it. –\nContemplate on this. \nDeclare – You will always have strong feeling connection and experience the existence of Brahman, never entertain any thought current which brings incompletion with Existence.\"\"\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hS2fwW6cQlc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"hS2fwW6cQlc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"everything-exists-is-god-sarvam-brahmopanishadam-hs2fww6cqlc"}}
