Before entering into the different states of consciousness, understanding the different states of Consciousness, he explained the purpose of working and studying the consciousness. \nWhen you reclaim the pure consciousness state in you, that restful awareness, you get into a spot or a space where you see the whole. Not just things related to the 5 senses you are carrying but everything. When you see the whole the picture, your life changes. The idea about your life changes. \nJust this morning one person was asking him, \"Swamiji, every day morning we see you and so much goes on, someday a lot of good news, some days bad, but everyday you're back fresh, alive, satsang happens. How?\"\nHis reply was, \"I just know very clearly, experientially whatever may happen in the outer world, there is something in me that is untouched which I experience as me, will be eternally available doing its job of blessing, initiating, elevating human consciousness. Whatever I'm doing now I'll do as long as the sun and moon exist. I just know that I am eternal. What I am doing will be happening eternally. Whatever gives me fulfillment will be going on around me eternally. That is the only reason nothing is shaking me. Please Understand, when you rest in the pure consciousness, this understanding will land in you. With that understanding, living your life is living enlightenment.\"\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
