Naturally many of the problems you think are problems disappear. Enlightenment means having expanded, complete understanding about the cosmos continuously and the ability to maintain that understanding in your bio memory and muscle memory.\"\n\n\"If you sit and watch some movie about space, where they explain in a detailed way about the sun, moon, stars etc, you will be completely transported to a different space. Suddenly, when you come back, you will come back to your continent, country, city, finally to the compound where you're staying. You will feel, in such a huge universe, we are dust.\"\n\n\"Similarly, when travelling by plane, and the aircraft lands in the compound of the airport, you just think, where was I and where am I? That's exactly the way I feel whenever I open my eyes, where was I and where am I? The moment the aircraft lands in the airport, your very consciousness is getting into an ideological prison, this country, state, law, regulations, poor human beings.\"\n\n\"If you understand the 5 elements in a very broad way, then, understand the depth of the freedom you will experience. When you understand that life is bigger, broader, in these 5 dimensions - elements, sense organs, nature attributes, time factor, awareness states, even if you understand one element, so much of freedom is experienced. If in just one element you are liberated, how you feel, in me, I am liberated in all five, imagine how would it feel - still I land here to tell you how it feels up there. Even most of my disciples don't look beyond this form.\"\n\n\"Even if you experience the freedom in understanding one element, you will understand how binding this ordinary world is. If you understand the freedom in all dimensions, and are able to retain that in your bio memory, that is what I call enlightenment.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6kg4i9PY1Yw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA5QBafU2fC5pbwqFXzDKyMelrmHQ","youtubeID":"6kg4i9PY1Yw","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"32"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"altered-states-of-consciousness-part-2-patanjali-yoga-sutra-119-nithyananda-satsang-17-feb-2011-6kg4i9py1yw"}}
