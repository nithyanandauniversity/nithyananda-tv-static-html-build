He outlines how and why eating non-vegetarian food is not only unhealthy for our body but also our memory, bioenergy, thoughts, emotions, and even the health of our unborn children. Studies show that meat based diets result in more depression, fear, and agitation causing more crime and unrest in society. Eat vegetarian and keep your body pure and your life exciting and joyful!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all the important personalities gathered in the Conference:  Chairman of the International Vegetarian Union: Marly Winckler, President of the Asian Vegetarian Union: Professor Duo Li, Chairman of the Malaysian Vegetarian Society: Dr. P. Vaidyalingam, Secretary of the Malaysian Vegetarian Society: Mr. Krishna, Treasurer of the Malaysian Vegetarian Society: Mr. Rajkumar Seth, Master Lim Boon Tiam from the Federation of I-Kuan Tao, Association Malaysia, Datto Vaidyalingam: Social Activist, and all other delegates from all over the world, And our devotees, disciples who are sitting with us for the Nithya Satsangh.\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects!\n\nI am happy to be with you all on the occasion of the 41st International Vegetarian Union, World Veg Fest and the 6th Asian Vegetarian Congress at Kuala Lumpur celebrating the 108th year of the Vegetarian Union!\n\nI will try to present a few facts and truths in front of you. Today's subject is \"AWAKENING THE POTENTIAL BIO-ENERGY, YOUR KUNDALINI ENERGY\".\n\nIn Sanskrit we have the word \"Kundalini\".  The equivalent English word can be, \"Awakening the inner potential energy, potential bio-energy\". Through the diet, awakening your potential energy!  We need to look into a few truths. Please understand, I am not going to speak about all the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle, because all of you know enough, and I can give tons and tons of material, the solid researches done by great universities published in many medical journals. But, now I am going to address a very important need for human-beings for their physical, psychological, social fulfillment -- awakening their potential energy; the inner potential energy, potential bio-energy; when this energy is awakened, the possibilities which open up for you, and how this can be awakened through the vegetarian diet, sattvic diet.\n\nAll of us know the health benefits of vegetarian food. I am not going to get into that now. I am really going to look into what is \"inner potential energy\", \"bio-energy\".\n\nThe first important fact I wanted to present to all of you is: \"YOU HAVE MORE POSSIBILITY THAN YOU ARE\"!  This is the beginning of life. This truth -- you have more possibility than you are -- is the beginning of life in any philosophy, any way of living, any way of thinking, any way of living, any system of thinking, or any religious thinking tradition. You have more possibility than what you are now. That \"more possibility\" is what we call bio-energy, inner potential energy.\n\nIn Sanskrit, we have the word \"Kundalini\".  You can see in your own life, when your power of feeling, your power of emotions expressed along with your power of words and power of thinking, the energy you express will be totally different.\n\nI will give you this example. When you utter some words, if your feeling is not associated with it, you know very clearly what kind of impact you create with that word inside you and outside you. Even while you are thinking, if your feeling is not associated with it, what kind of impact that thinking does inside you and outside you!  Feeling infuses energy into your thinking and words. There is something in you which infuses energy into your feeling. That is what we call \"Kundalini\", \"bio-energy\", \"bio-memory\",\n\n\"Inner potential energy\"!  All these different words are used, but it explains, expresses this one concept -- The power which resides in you and gives power to your feeling.  All of you can understand how your power gives life to you. You all know, if your feeling is associated with a certain word, how that word becomes alive for you, if your feeling is associated with your thinking, how that thinking becomes alive for you; but, unfortunately, we do not know how our feeling gets empowered.\n\nThe energy which empowers your feeling is \"inner potential energy\", the \"bio-energy\".  Now I wanted you to understand how the various diets impact that inner potential energy.\n\nThe first truth I wanted to present in front of all of you is: \"YOU BECOME WHAT YOU EAT! ANYTHING\n\nYOU EAT, THAT BECOMES YOU!\"\n\nOne part of what you eat becomes your bone, muscle, flesh, blood.  One part of what you eat becomes\n\nyour words.  One part of what you eat becomes your thinking.  One part of what you eat becomes your feeling.  One part of what you eat becomes your being!\n\nSo, the first truth I presented is: What is inner potential energy, Kundalini Shakti, what is bio-energy or bio-memory.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ysr2PhnZi7w/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCqDR_hOGp29B3wK2PEgEVJZQj0Rg","youtubeID":"Ysr2PhnZi7w","viewCount":107919,"eventDate":"2013-10-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"why-vegetarianism-nithyananda-ysr2phnzi7w"}}
