When we are a cause for enlightenment, we are living in a state of completion and creativity, experiencing joy and spiritual strength. Let us be a light to help others reach their goals!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, the day of Nithyananda Sangha! Formally we inaugurated the Nithyananda Dhyanapeeta on this very land, eleven years ago in 2003, on this very day.  Eleven year over! My blessings to all of you who were causing this Sangha \n\nPlease understand, everyone is part; whether you have done a small work of just giving one small photograph or card about me to somebody, not only good work, even people who have done abusal, they made us strong!  Understand, even they made us strong!  We became more and more strong, invincible!  So, by making us strong, contributed to Sangha! Understand, whether you supported us in a small way or big way, abused us, whatever may be, all of you caused this Sangha to happen. All of you should know, even people who abused us, have given us any lessons about life.  They taught us 'Don't be in a fantasy that all over the world, everywhere, you will be accepted.  We are also here! You need to sharpen your intelligence!  You need to sharpen yourself to cater to us!'\n\nI tell you, if you can drive in the traffic of Kolkatta, you can drive anywhere in the world!  Kolkatta drivers can be directly given International Driving Licence!  Same way, if you can be successful in Tamil Nadu, you will be successful anywhere in the world!  If somebody worked with the logic of a Tamilian, he can be successful anywhere in the world!  Immediately they can be given the title \"Jagath Guru\"! Really I am telling you, even the people who abused us made us do more homework to sharpen our intelligence to do the mission which we want to do.  They are not ready to accept. They want us to do more homework about what we are offering, what we are sharing with the world. So, in a way, even they contributed!  Every time, this is the way I look at the life. \n\nSo, whenever somebody abuses, I always look in and say, 'Alright, so now they are also extension of us.  There is some part which is extension of us which need to be given more intelligence, more clarity, proper method to complete and overcome the incompletions.  Let us work.' So, I thank everyone who caused us the way we are now this moment. \n\nWhether you contributed to us in smaller way, or bigger way, or positive way, or negative way, whatever way, we thank everyone who caused us the way we are existing now at this moment.  It is so beautiful! O Sangha, I sincerely thank you all! Sangha is a living organism, not organization. Organism! It is a synergy.  The different energies in sync, that is what I call \"synergy\" of so many of you. It is an embodiment of Mahadeva, blessing all of us and the whole world.  Understand, the Dhamma of win-win is Sangha.  Where both of us win, that principle, that dhamma is Sangha.  Whoever becomes part, everyone wins, no one loses. \n\nToday is the day eleven years before -- actually, eleven years completed; with today we are completing eleven years -- formally, officially, today evening I ascended on the throne of Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam, establishing it. So, by today evening, we are completing eleven years and entering into twelfth year.  2003, January 1st, in the evening, Nithyananda Dhyanapeeta Mahasamsthana Simhasana was established and \"aarohana\" was done.  We have caused enlightenment in so many lives in so many ways,continue to cause so much of auspicious things in so many lives.  We will continue to cause enlightenment to the whole universe. \nOn this auspicious New Year and the Nithyananda Sangha Day, I bless you all.  Let us align ourselves back to Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching, and causing enlightenment to ourselves and others. Understand, this is the New Year Oath we should take.  This is the New Year Oath we should take. Let us complete with all the past incompletions.  Let us complete with all the past incompletions. It is time we rededicate ourselves to Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching and causing enlightenment to ourselves and others.  And we reinvent ourselves, rediscover ourselves, recreate ourselves, to live the great science of causing enlightenment, the great truth of causing enlightenment. Be very clear, you and others are not two different things. Others are extensions of you, you are extension of others.  The extension of others in you is you, The extension of you in outside is others.  So, when you cause enlightenment to others, you cause enlightenment to you.  When you cause enlightenment to you authentically, you WILL cause enlightenment to others.  They two are not","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xzIPdmvEykQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA0X68vBdcY1DwAIG2z3Dk-5K02fA","youtubeID":"xzIPdmvEykQ","viewCount":2326,"eventDate":"2014-01-02","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"reinvent-rediscover-recreate-to-live-the-great-principle-of-causing-enlightenment-xzipdmveykq"}}
