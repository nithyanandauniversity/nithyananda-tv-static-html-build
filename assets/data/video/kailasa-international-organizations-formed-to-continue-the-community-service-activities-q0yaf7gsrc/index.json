IT IS A FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE FROM PARAMASHIVA HIMSELF - THE LINEAGE OF LIVING STREAM OF ENLIGHTENED MASTERS.\n\n*YOGA PATTABHISHEKAM WAS DONE FORMALLY AND THEY HANDED OVER THE TRADITION FOR ME TO CARRY ON FROM THEN ON STARTED THE REVIVAL OF KAILASA. IT IS ALMOST 26 YEARS.\n\n*THE DAY I STARTED CARVING THE DEITY AFTER HAVING VISION OF DEVI DARSHAN, BIRTHING OF DEVI IN THE FORM OF DEITY WHEN I STARTED, THAT DAY THE SACRED ARTS UNIVERSITY STARTED. FORTUNATELY THAT WAS THE TIME I USED TO BE SEEING ARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA PHYSICALLY . LITERALLY HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BIRTH THE DEITY AND FROM THAT DAY THE NITHYANANDA SACRED ARTS UNIVERCITY STARTED. BUT WE HAVE STARTED ORGANISING OURSELVES IN MAYBE 2002. I STILL REMEMBER, TIRUCHI SWAMIGAL ONE OF THE GREATEST INFLUENCE IN MY LIFE, IN BENGALURU HE HAS AN ASHRAM KAILASA ASHRAM. HE BUILT A HUGE RAJARAJESHWARI TEMPLE AND MANY TEMPLE ALL OVER.\n\n*WHEN I HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF SITTING AT HIS FEET AND HAVING THE TRAINING..I HAVE SEEN HIM PERSONALLY DOING VADAM KAAYAVIKKIRATHU (MAKING SNACKS) - ALSO SEEN HIM DRAWING WITH CHARCOAL ON FLOOR SITTING WITH STHAPATIS OR WITH PEN.\n\n*USUALLY WHEN HE SITS ON THE FLOOR, HE WILL SIT WITH THE STHAPATIS ON THE FLOOR WHICH IS VERY RARE. USUALLY DISCIPLES WILL BE SENT OUT. WE WERE ALL SITTING. THE MOMENT HE SAID GET THE CHARCOAL ALL WALKED OUT AND I ALSO WALKED OUT. BUT HE PERSONALLY CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO SIT.\nHE USED TO TREAT THE STHAPATI LIKE HIS OWN SON BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIM FROM WHEN HE WAS A KID.\n\n*HE STARTED DRAWING TO TELL HOW DEITIES EYES EARS ALL SHOULD COME. I WAS WONDERING WHY HE ASKED ME TO SIT. HE SAID IN SINGULAR, ‘AYE SEE!YOU HAVE TO BUILD A LOT!”\n\nOF COURSE I WILL TAKE THAT AS A BLESSING. HIS VAK SIDDHI. THE WORD HE UTTERED IS MANIFESTING THROUGH ME.\n\nARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA INITIATED ME INTO THE SCIENCE OF BIRTHING DEITIES AND KAILASA ASHRAM TIRUCHI SWAMI INSPIRED ME, EDUCATED ME, EVOLVED ME WITH MORE AND MORE OF PRESENTING THE CULTURE.\n\n*HE IS AN EXPERT, ADEPT IN TEMPLE SCIENCE AND TEMPLE BASED LIFESTYLE\n\n*IN TAMILNADU, THERE IS A SMALL COMMUNITY NATTUKOTTAI NAGARATHAR. THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS TEMPLE BASED LIFESTYLE.\n\n*WHOLE ASHRAM OF TIRUCHI SWAMI IS FROM THAT NATTUKOTTAI NAGARATHAR CULTURE. SO BEAUTIFULLY HE WILL RUN EVERYTHING. I USED TO WONDER ABOUT THE METICULOUSNESS WHICH I AM STILL STRUGGLING TO BRING IN KAILASA.\n\nEACH OBJECT WILL BE KEPT ONLY IN ITS PLACE\n\n*AND THE WAY THE TEMPLE IS RUN - EXTREME SINCERITY!\n\nARUNAGIRI YOGISHWARA INITIATED, TIRUCHI SWAMI INSPIRED AND IN 2002, IT STARTED EVOLVING AS A UNIVERSITY. I USED TO PERSONALLY GO TO MAHABALIPURAM AND FIRST STARTED CARVING LOS ANGELES VENKATESHWARA. I WANTED TO START WITH GANAPATI. SO SMALL GANAPATI AND THEN LOS ANGELES VENKATESHWARA THEN NITHYANANDESHWARA PARAMASHIVA IN OHIO AND THEN THE UNIVERCITY EVOLVED. EACH OF THE WORK, WE ARE NOW MAKING IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION\n\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4112263565528129","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Q0y_Af7GSRc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Q0y_Af7GSRc","viewCount":2186,"eventDate":"2020-07-23","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasa-international-organizations-formed-to-continue-the-community-service-activities-q0yaf7gsrc"}}
