The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 37, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) discusses the crucial value of personal experience to spirituality. Experience is the fire that burns away our ignorance. In Paramahamsa's beautiful words, \"Experience flows into your system like a current and makes your mind stop functioning in the same patterns.\" Paramahamsa gives a strong technique to ascertain that we do not stop short of the ultimate experience possible in life. When we set goals for ourselves, we may cease to expand once they are achieved. If instead we invite the Divine to forever move us onward toward the ultimate, we will never settle down complacently before we have fulfilled our possibility. When we sit in meditation our prayer should be, \"Let me not be contented before the ultimate experience is showered upon me.\"\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nLet's enter into today's satsang in Bhagavad Gita:\n\n4th Chapter Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga 37th Verse; \n\nyathaidhaamsi samiddognihi \nbhasmasaat-kuruterjuna |\njnaanaagnihi sarva-karmaani\nbhasmasaat-kurute tathaa ||\n\nAs the fire that is kindled burns into ashes the fuel, Oh Arjuna! in the same manner the fire of experience burns into ashes all the actions the patterns that keep making the person repeat the same action !Oh God! These are all straight attack. Understand, Bhagavan is not talking to you in a roundabout way. Simple truths very straight! He says straight away, just like fire burns the fuel; the experience burns all the patterns, over. I don't know what to comment on this. Such a simple truth being expressed in such a small number of words. Please understand such beautiful truth expressed in such a small number of words! Just as a blazing fire turns firewood into ashes; blazing fire turns fuel into ashes, the experience turns all the patterns into ashes. So strive in all possible ways to achieve experience.\n \nLet me define experience, what is experience? Experience is: something flows into your system like a current or a vibration, makes your mind stop working in the same patterns in which it is functioning. Sometimes it can be very light current flow, sometimes it can be a wild explosion but the vibrations which moves into your system and makes you understand the strong truth about yourself. See, that is the reason the Kundalini awakening and Levitation liberates you so quickly, because every time I awaken your Kundalini, you are programmed to my inner space; pattern less space; every time your body jumps some part of your patterns are destroyed. Every time your body moves, some part of your patterns are taken away. You can see, every time when your body levitates, tell yourself this time I will be free from this pattern. I tell you every time it is renovating your system. That is exactly the right word - renovating your system. Every time, the system in which you are living is renovated and rejuvenated because experience breaks any number of patterns. You may be thinking No, No, No, not mine; you don't know the amount of patterns I have; but whether it is one ton fire wood or one million ton firewood, kindled fire is capable of putting off; burning any amount of fire wood into ashes.\n \nSo the kindled experience, the awakened Kundalini is capable of burning any amount of karmas, patterns into ashes. Work, work, work, with all the intensity to experience the Ultimate to experience the Ultimate! Kindled experience can lead you to any level, any amount, any path; kindled experience can show you the truth. Kindled experience can lead you to reality, awakened Kundalini can program you inner space pattern free. So work again and again and again and again for experience. Every day I am receiving more and more emails that people are practicing Prana samyama. I am very happy about it because, wasting the time without working for experience is the crime. That is the reason, every day I remind you to work for experience. Every day I insist you put your awareness and energy towards experience, the methods directly leading to experience: Unclutching, Feeling connection, Ajapa japa; Enchanting, Feeling connection, Unclutching!\n \nConstantly I remind you, it is for experience, the whole Dhyanapeetam is created for experience, all these temples are created for experience. I am sitting alive for experience, to give experience! I am bearing with all these nonsensical foolish enmity. Yesterday again one Bull sorry bull is sacred for Hindus, one Donkey, of course even Donkey is also sacred for Hindus, what to do everything is sacred for us; all right, one dash dash is telling me,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OfARj_qxwJ4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCw7CxdMRnrnVqNwy5R7YuElmWtCQ","youtubeID":"OfARj_qxwJ4","viewCount":416,"eventDate":"2012-08-25","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"experience-is-the-only-religion-ofarjqxwj4"}}
