MY BLESSINGS TO ALL THE GRADUATES.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM KAILASA:\n\n*IT IS LIKE ALMOST A BRIEFING OF THE COSMOS; COSMOS BRIEFING YOU ABOUT THE HAPPENINGS OF THE UNIVERSE AND PLANET EARTH.\n\n*PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY OF THIS PRALAYA - PANDEMIC HAPPENING:\n\n*”EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ACCELERATED”, IS WHAT I AM SAYING AS SUPERCONSCIOUS BREAKTHROUGH HAPPENING.\n\n*UNIVERSE IS CONSCIOUSNESS. IT WAS EXPANDING, EXPANDING AND EXPANDING... SUDDENLY THE EXPANSION IS ACCELERATED. IT IS NOT THE HAPPENING OF THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT ALONE. THE HAPPENING IS CONSCIOUS.\n\n*THE PLACE WHERE ATHEISTS AND SPIRITUAL SCIENTISTS DIFFER IS : ATHEISTS ARE TRYING TO SAY THE WHOLE COSMOS IS ACCIDENT OR COINCIDENCE OF MATERIALISTIC HAPPENINGS. TO ALL MY DISCIPLES, FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, IN TUNE WITH THE DECLARATIONS OF VEDA AGAMIC RISHIS WHO ARE THE INNER WORLD SCIENTISTS WHO KNOW THE COSMOS FROM THE GREAT HINDU TRADITION, AND PARAMASHIVA HIMSELF, “UNIVERSE IS CONSCIOUSNESS”.\n\nISHA VASYAM IDAGUM SARVAM\nWHATEVER EXISTS IS CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\n*THE SUPERCONSCIOUS BREAKTHROUGH IS WHAT SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING AS “EXPANSION IS ACCELERATED”.\n\n*THE GREATEST GOOD NEWS FOR ALL OF MY DISCIPLES - WHOEVER RECOGNISES MY IDENTITY - IS: “YOU CAN USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REACH KAILASA!” JUST PLAN YOUR FUTURE WITH YOUR HOPES, POSSIBILITIES, VISIONS. YOU DO NOT HAVE FEAR. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE YOUR FEARS.\n\n*HOPING FOR THE BEST, PREPARING FOR THE WORST IS THE WAY ANY ORDINARY HUMAN BEING FUNCTIONS. BUT FOR YOU: HOPE FOR THE BEST AND GO ON WORKING FOR THE BEST. YOU HAVE NO WORST!\n\n*UNIVERSE IS GOING THROUGH A POWERFUL SUPERCONSCIOUS BREAKTHROUGH. ENJOY YOUR PLANS, HOPES, POSSIBILITIES. GO ON WORKING FOR IT CONSCIOUSLY.\n\n*UNSUBSTANTIATED FEARS FORM A MAGNETIC FORCE TO ATTRACT NEGATIVITY IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU START BECOMING FRUSTRATED, VIOLENT, MURDEROUS.\n\n*THE CORE MASS FOR A MURDERER IS UNSUBSTANTIATED FEAR. THE CORE MASS FOR A NORMAL HUMAN BEING IS PARAMASHANTASWARUPA. THE CORE MASS FOR YOU SHOULD BE PARAMASHANTASWARUPA. ABSOLUTE TAYGA, UNCLUTCHING, POWERFULNESS, SURRENDER TO PARAMASHIVA, FEELING CONNECTION WITH PARAMASHIVA, ONENESS WITH PARAMASHIVA... ALL THESE ARE MULTIPLE WORDS BUT SAME SPACE. IF YOU START DEVELOPING YOUR CORE CONSCIOUSLY WITH THE 5 PRACTICES - UNCLUTCHING, AJAPA JAPA OF MAHAVAKYA, ONENESS, COMPLETION… YOU FORM THE CORE FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE.\n\n*UNSUBSTANTIATED FEARS CAUSE DELUSIONARY BLIND SPOTS, SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, DELUSIONARY ARROGANCE. STOP THE UNSUBSTANTIATED FEARS WITH ALL THE PRACTICES.\n\n*I AM NOT SAYING, DON'T RUN AWAY IF A POISONOUS SNAKE ENTERS YOUR ROOM. I AM ONLY SAYING, STOP ALL UNSUBSTANTIATED FEARS FROM SHAKING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CONSCIOUSLY. SNAKE MAY ENTER RARELY INTO YOUR ROOM. IF I SEE THE PERCENTAGE OF IN HOW MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES SNAKE ENTERED INTO THE ROOM, IT IS LESS THAN 0.001 %. BUT HOW MANY HAVE VISUALISED AND ALLOWED THIS FEAR TO SHAKE THEIR SYSTEM... I CAN SAY 99.9999%!\n\n*CASUALLY, A THOUGHT OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND YOU DEALING WITH IT AND DROPPING IS OK. BUT TONES OF TIME YOUR UNSUBSTANTIATED FEARS SHAKE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM. DROP IT. YOU CAN EASILY DROP BY UNCLUTCHING. IF YOU START PRACTISING UNCLUTCHING, YOU WILL NOT KNOW HOW MANY FEARS WILL DROP. YOUR INNER SPACE WILL BE SHINING LIKE PARAMASHIVA WITH NO BLIND SPOT, NO UNSUBSTANTIATED FEAR, FRUSTRATION, ANGER.\n\n*ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT KNOWN TO YOU, DO NOT BE AFRAID OF IT. FOR EXAMPLE: IF YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY, WILL YOU BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING ELSE UNDER HIS RULE? SAME WAY, ALL MY DISCIPLES WHO DECLARED YOUR INTEGRITY TO ME, BE ASSURED: PARAMASHIVA KNOWS YOU. IT IS MY PROMISE TO YOU. BE LOVING, DON'T BE ARROGANT. JUST BE RELAXED. YOU ARE PROTECTED. NA ME BHAKTAH PRANASHYATI.\n\nREAD MORE AT: www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4147497508671401","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hJqQrm8EGuA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"hJqQrm8EGuA","viewCount":3650,"eventDate":"2020-07-28","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"how-to-drop-unsubstantiated-fears-and-experience-superconscious-breakthrough-hjqqrm8egua"}}
