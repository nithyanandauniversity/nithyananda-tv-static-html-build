Paramahamsa Nithyananda gave the instructions for us to bring in and experience the Authentic Advaithic Experience. He told us to pin up our Inner, Outer Life and Others Image beside the bed and pin up all the incompletions we need to complete beside it. Every morning we are to declare completion; which has more to do with decision than technique.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\nListen!  Today's satsangh is all about \"DOING\".  Yes!  You had enough time and time extension, both, to complete the homework of discovering incompletions.  Please understand, first I gave time.  Then, by the order of a few devotees, I extended it.  Even asking for more time to discover your incompletions is one more incompletion!  But I tolerated, because you should not be using that as a reason for why you didn't discover all your incompletions.  Now you know.  You know.  You got time.  Now it is time!  You cannot afford to wait any more. \n \nListen! From today, we will start moving towards Completion.  The first step you should take is, listen, now you wrote all the incompletions.  It can be as less as twenty-five to thirty, or as huge as one-thousand, two-thousand.  Now, decide, from this moment these incompletions will not have power over your decision or cognition.  Listen!  Understand the meaning of this word.  Even till you complete, these incompletions cannot have power over your cognition, your decision-making.  You can sit and complete all these day by day, one by one.  See, for an elephant..... \n \nI have seen temple elephants eating.  They will catch hold of a huge bunch of sugarcane.  They will eat the sugarcane one by one, or two-three.  But, till they complete eating, till they eat, they will not allow anybody else to come and touch the sugarcane.  Once they declare it is theirs, it is theirs!  They may be slowly eating, or not eating, they may eat even tomorrow or day-after-tomorrow, but no one can touch it!  Same way, you may complete tomorrow or day-after-tomorrow, but those incompletions cannot have power over you, be very clear! \n \nDeclare Completion NOW!  You know all this is incompletion.  Understand, Completion works more with your conscious decision.  Completion works more with your conscious decision.  Completion is more a conscious decision, less a technique.  Pranayama, Yoga, all of them are more a technique, less a conscious decision.  But Completion is more a conscious decision, less a technique.  Means, your decision plays a major role in completing than actual technique.  You just decide now you are complete....over! \n \nI never did in my life sitting and reliving, or looking at the mirror twenty-four hours.  I never did all these things.  Simply, my Masters showed me, 'Hey, this is incompletion!  Drop it.'  Over! \n \nSo, it is your decision that plays a major role!  See, this penning down is like identification.  Now what you penned down, even if it is twenty-five pages, you should paste it next to your bed.  And, every day, for the next few days, you should read that and tell yourself, 'I am complete with all these.'  After a few days, you will be bored to read them, because they have no more power over you!  Then you can tear them up and put it in the dustbin.  You should feel bored to read your incompletions; then you are COMPLETE!  You will feel, 'What is this?  It looks like somebody else said all this!  Why am I reading?'\n \nSee, when I speak to some of the people who come to me for healing....  Recently, some people came to me for healing....psychological sufferings.  They came to India from both sides Muslim countries after being tortured.  And, you know, the worst thing, it is not that only Hindus are tortured in Bangladesh and Pakistan; many Muslims are tortured, and they run away to India for a peaceful life!  So, some of them came to attend the satsangh and have blessings.  When I listened to their problems and the deep....I am honestly telling you, with all my compassion and love for that soul, I put my hand on them and attended to them, healed them, but for a moment I thought, 'Oh God!  Thank God I was born in Bharat!  Let us keep this Bharat alive!'  Because, I cannot even imagine this amount of suffering can be put into people!  I was so shocked! \n \nSame way, I have seen some of the Sri Lankan Tamils who moved to Toronto and Malaysia, even in Tamil Nadu, when they come for healing, ask for healing, Oh, God, when I put my hand on them and try to heal, the amount of pain!  Only then you will understand all your incompletions are foolishness!  Because you don't have suffering, you just create suffering!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o280qgS1mMY/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"o280qgS1mMY","viewCount":2337,"eventDate":"2014-04-22","duration":1066,"likeCount":54,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"taste-the-joy-of-completion-o280qgs1mmy"}}
