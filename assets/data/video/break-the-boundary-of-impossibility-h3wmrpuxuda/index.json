Our words have immense power so it is important to practice choosing the words we give to ourselves and others carefully. Using the right words keeps our inner space clear of conflict which in turn increase our longevity. Let us use the power of words to break the boundary of impossibilities!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday is the first day of Aipashi Thula Maasa, Poornima.  Today is Annabhisheka to our Nithyanandeshwara.  And evening, after the Pradosha Puja, you can all watch the Annabhisheka live at 4:30 pm Indian Standard Time.     \n\nWith this, I welcome all of you with my love and blessings! \n\nToday's subject of Nithya Satsang is about the Power of Words, Power of Thinking, Power of Feeling and Power of Living!\n\nI was talking about the Power of Words; how it's one of the important powers we all have, but we have not harnessed \n\nPeople come and tell me, 'Swamiji, give me some siddhis, extraordinary powers.'\n\nI tell them, 'Come on, the siddhis with which I sent you to Planet Earth, why don't you harness them first?  The siddhis which I have already given you, harness them first, express them first.  Then you can start getting the other siddhis.'\n\nThe day of Vijaya Dashami, during Kanya Puja, I told my kids to bless the world, and asked them to bless, \"Let the heavens shower\".  I thought it did not rain.  But next day they told me, 'night it rained, Swamiji!  It rained!'  See, usually, the \"heavens shower\" has a meaning, like a drizzle it'll shower; not like heavy rain, but like a drizzle it will shower for some time, like flowers are showered from the heaven.   I heard that it happened!  I was thinking, \"how come my kids, where is the power of their Integrity, their Vaak Siddhi?\"  And they proved it!  I congratulate the kids! \n\n\"Hey, all the kids who received Kanya Puja raise the hands; so your Integrity has worked, great!\"\n\nAnd, all I am trying to tell you is, first harness the Power of Words, Power of Thinking.  Harness the Power of Words through Integrity.  Harness the Power of Thinking through Authenticity. Harness the Power of Feeling by feeling Responsible. Harness the Power of Living by Enriching! \n\nI tell you, this Inner Awakening Level-4 is all about making this as an experience in you!  Making this as an experience in you! I commit with you all, I'll make sure you experience these Powers of Vaak Siddhi, the Powers of Leadership Consciousness, and the Powers of Authenticity!  See the Power of Authenticity is you will live in eternal possibility.  You don't have the feeling that anything is impossible. Breaking the border, boundary of impossibility! \n\nPlease understand, if you see in the shipyards, boatyards, you will see a wall separating one bit of ocean where the ships and boats are stationed. That small wall gives the feeling, that area is separate from the ocean to protect the boats from the high waves.  If the wall is broken, that shipyard and the ocean is one and the same! Same way, the idea of impossibility separates you from the Cosmos, separates you from God. Whenever you say \"This is not possible for me\", you are a human separated from God!  Please understand, breaking the boundary of impossibility! I am not saying you will start flying, you will start walking on water! I am not saying that!  But, all I am saying is, you know you created the law of who can fly, which can fly, what can fly; who can walk on water, which can walk, where can walk.  So, you know you are the owner of the Constitution, you are the Head of the Constitution of the Cosmos.  So, you can do what you want!  You can fly by taking the bird body.  You can fly by assuming the bird's body.  So, you know you are the Head of the Constitution of the Cosmos. You know you created the law. So, you know what all you can express through the body and what all you can't express because you designed the body in such a way. And, same way, I am not saying you will not have any benefit other than intellectual understanding.  No!  You may not be able to fly, but you will be able to really, really run fast! So, many powers which your body has, which you have not opened, can be opened!  Many powers which your body has, which you have not opened, can be opened!\n\n \n\nA few days before, one devotee came in the morning Sarva darshan and asked me, 'Swamiji, give me Vaak Siddhi. I should somehow convince my parents to let me come to the ashram regularly. They are not letting me come here at all. They are pressurizing me seeing and believing these false news propagated by the paid media. I have to come here secretly!'\n\nI laughed! In those days, youngsters secretly used to go to the wrong places. But now, to come to the ashram, they have to come secretly!  At least secretly they come only to the ashram, to a spiritual place! I was laughing.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3WmRPuxUDA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDXv89zBb4vb_3P3Q7FZu2xManVtw","youtubeID":"h3WmRPuxUDA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"break-the-boundary-of-impossibility-h3wmrpuxuda"}}
