How natural this is what we all long every moment and but still so ignorant about it. This discourse is a life changer and a definite mover.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I wanted to expand on the Space of Completion and Friendliness. \n \nAfter a long time I took four hours continuous session yesterday! I do take the Inner Awakening Sessions.....sometimes I do take four hours session, but it will not be like all the four hours I will be speaking; I will be guiding them into some contemplation, intranalyzing, and they will be doing that. That way it will be. But now, yesterday, it was like whole four hours I was literally talking to them, other than some small breaks, small gaps. \n\nYesterday itself I thought that today I will expand on this, give more insights to Inner Awakening participants, and give the essence of Inner Awakening to all the satsanghis, doing both.\n \nI will expand on Friendliness and Completion.  Please listen!\n \nThe Completion you carry inside you, the space of Completion you carry inside you, however it comes in contact with whoever, it expresses only as friendless! Understand, when there is a pot full of nectar, whether you pour it this way or that way, put your hand and drink it or put your mouth directly and drink it, or you break the pot, only nectar will come out. Same way, when you carry the space of Completion, when you carry the space of Completion, with whoever you come in contact, in whatever form, you will ooze friendliness, you will radiate friendliness.\n \nYesterday, in the session, I was expanding on different bhavas like Mathru Bhava, Dasa Bhava, Sakha Bhava -- means, the attitude you have towards mother, attitude you have towards the Lord, Master, attitude you have towards the friend -- and Vatsalya Bhava, attitude you have towards the child....various bhavas. \n \nSomebody asked me, 'Can there be friendliness between husband and wife?'\n \nPlease understand, in any bhava, the juice is friendliness. Mother and son become good mother and son when there is friendliness between both of them; father and son become good father and son when there is friendliness between both of them; husband and wife become a great couple when there is friendliness between both of them; Lord and the servants, Master and the disciples, they become great Master and disciples when there is friendliness between them. In any bhava, any attitude, the friendliness between them makes the relationship.\n \nPlease understand, it is friendliness that is the essence of life. It is friendliness that is the essence of life! Friendliness is nothing but positive self-fulfilling prediction about the other person. Listen, I am defining it. Whenever you have a self-fulfilling negative prediction about the other person, you are waiting to break it. When you are waiting to break it, all your attitude, everything will be fuming with anger, agitation, irritation. Friendliness is self-fulfilling positive prophecy about the other person. \n \nAll your prophecies are powerful enough for self-fulfilling. Means, if you decide that today your day is going to be a very bad day in the morning, it IS going to be a very bad day, because you know how to pick up the bad things, assemble them, and see today is a bad day. You are capable of it! You will even make it and do it! There are some blackmailing media in India, just for some news they want to show somebody as bad, they make him as bad, and portray him as bad.  Understand, if you decide that today is going to be a good day, you know how to make it a good day. Even if there is something wrong, you will stand and struggle, and that struggle you will make it as, 'See, how I responded! It is a good day!' You know how to make a good day or bad day. Any prophecy you create, it is powerful enough to fulfil itself. All prophecies are self-fulfilling.\n \nListen! When you see a person, if you have self-fulfilling positive prophecy about him -- 'This person is going to be part of my life for quite a long time' -- only then the attitude you radiate towards that person is friendliness. Friendliness is an attitude you radiate towards the person with whom you take a positive decision. Completion makes you take a positive decision towards whole life. Understand, Completion is something which makes you cognize, decide positively towards the whole life. Anything which makes you to decide positively towards the whole life is Completion. Because life is complete, Completion makes you decide FOR life.  Listen! Because life is complete, Completion makes you decide FOR life! Because life is complete,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-mUaq0wWWDA/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"-mUaq0wWWDA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"friendliness-is-the-essence-of-life-muaq0wwwda"}}
