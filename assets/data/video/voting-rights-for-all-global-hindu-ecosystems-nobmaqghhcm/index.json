NOW THIS IS AN INITIATION, NOT JUST WORDS.\n\n*SIT STRAIGHT!\n\n*I AM GOING TO INITIATE ALL OF YOU TO MANIFEST PARAMASHIVA IN ALL THE 36 TATTVAS (PRINCIPLES).\n\n*I AM PREPARING ALL OF YOU FOR KAILASA ADMINISTRATION AND HINDU PARLIAMENT.\n\n*THAT IS WHY FROM TODAY, THERE WILL BE TWO SATSANGS. I WILL GIVE ENGLISH SATSANG AND TAMIL SATSANG. IF YOU KNOW BOTH LANGUAGES, YOU CAN ENJOY BOTH SATSANGS! YOU WILL ENJOY 3 - 4 HOURS TREAT!\n\n*I WANT TO SINCERELY PREPARE ALL OF YOU TO BE PART OF KAILASA ADMINISTRATION, KAILASA GOVERNANCE AND HINDU PARLIAMENT SYSTEM. WE ARE DOING THIS VERY SINCERELY AND SERIOUSLY.\n\n*WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED CHALKING OUT, PENNING DOWN AND DETAILING.\n\n*WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE 5 STRUCTURES OF THE HINDU PARLIAMENT: CHIT SABHA, RAJA SABHA, DEVA SABHA, KANAKA SABHA AND NITHYANANDA SABHA.\n\n*WE WILL BE GIVING VOTING RIGHT TO ALL HINDU ECOSYSTEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD, WHETHER A TEMPLE RUNNING IN TRINIDAD TOBAGO OR A GREAT MONASTERY RUNNING IN RISHIKESH.\n\n*WE HAVE CLASSIFIED THE HINDU ECOSYSTEMS INTO 11 VARIETIES:\n\nFIRST COMPONENT: TEMPLES\nSECOND COMPONENT: YOGA STUDIOS, YOGA CENTERS, YOGA TRAINING PLACES.\n\nTHIRD COMPONENT: ALL PUBLIC PLACES THAT RUN WITH HINDU PRINCIPLES.\n\nFOURTH COMPONENT: HINDU MONASTERIES AND NUNNERIES.\n\nFIFTH COMPONENT - ALL THE HINDU GURUKULS!\n\n*MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHO ARE NOT BORN HINDUS, GET INTRODUCED TO HINDUISM THROUGH YOGA STUDIOS. DENYING THE RIGHTFUL PLACE OF YOGA STUDIOS IN HINDUISM WILL BE ONLY A LOSS FOR HINDUISM.YOGA STUDIOS ALL OVER THE WORLD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INTRODUCTORY ECOSYSTEM FOR HINDUISM.\n\n*ALL YOGA TEACHERS AND YOGA STUDIOS SHOULD BE GIVEN THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE AND RESPECT. THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO FEEL WELCOMED.\n\n*JUST LIKE TEMPLES, ALL YOGA STUDIOS WHERE YOGA HAPPENS EVERYDAY, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE ECOSYSTEMS OF HINDUISM.\n\n*ECOSYSTEM MEANS, WHERE YOU MAY NOT HAVE ONE LEAD, ONE HEAD, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW SO MANY THINGS. EACH ONE CONTRIBUTES TO THE OTHER. EVERYONE LEARNS FROM EVERYONE!\n\n*TAKE A TEMPLE - IT IS NOT THAT ONE PERSON IS THE HEAD OF THE TEMPLE. THERE ARE SOME TEMPLES WHERE ONE PERSON LEADS THE WHOLE THING IN A VERY ORGANIZED WAY.\n\n*FOR EXAMPLE, NALLUR MURUGAN TEMPLE HAS THE FAMILY - MAAPAANA MUDALIAR’S FAMILY! THEIR DEDICATION IS EXTRAORDINARY. SYMBOL OF SINCERITY!\n\n*BUT 99.9999% HINDU TEMPLES DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF LEAD BUT IT IS THE KIND OF ECOSYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY KNOWS HOW TO DO PUJA, SOMEBODY KNOWS HOW TO KEEP THE TEMPLE CLEAN, SOMEBODY KNOWS HOW TO CONDUCT FESTIVALS AND RITUALS, SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE BOOKS. ALL THESE PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER KNOW HOW TO MAINTAIN THE ECOSYSTEM!\n\n*SOME PEOPLE TRY TO GET AGITATED AND ASK ME, ‘HOW CAN YOU SAY TEMPLE IS ALSO AN ECOSYSTEM AND YOGA STUDIO IS ALSO AN ECOSYSTEM?HOW CAN YOU PUT THEM EQUAL?’\n\n*I AM NOT SAYING YOGA STUDIOS ARE EQUIVALENT TO TEMPLE OR TEMPLE IS EQUIVALENT TO YOGA STUDIO. I AM SAYING, EACH ONE IS UNIQUE BUT STRENGTHENING HINDUISM. THAT SHOULD BE RECOGNISED.\n\nTHIRD COMPONENT: ALL HINDUISM CENTERED BOOKSHOPS, GROCERY SHOPS, RESTAURANTS, ALL PUBLIC PLACES THAT RUN WITH HINDU PRINCIPLES.\n\n*EXAMPLE - STORES WHICH SELL HINDU CLOTHES, HINDU BOOKS, HINDU GROCERY ITEMS,ETC WHICH MAKES HINDUS’ LIFE EASY.\n\n*ALL OF YOU NEED TO KNOW, THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 CRORE PEOPLE OUTSIDE INDIA WHO ARE EITHER BORN OR PRACTISING HINDUS VERY SINCERELY.\n\n*WE CAN’T CONVENIENTLY FORGET THEM OR THEIR LIFE. IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE INDIA, AND PRACTISING HINDUISM, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HINDU BOOK STORES, HINDU CLOTHES STORES, HINDU GROCERY STORES, OR WHERE HINDU ARTS AND MUSIC ARE TAUGHT.\n\n*ALL THE THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIVING HINDUISM - ALL THOSE ALSO I CONSIDER AS ECOSYSTEMS, AS UNITS OF HINDUISM.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4287924047962079","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOBMaqGHHcM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLALb4RMvPRfG3Y8rgIKzLQrzBV6LQ","youtubeID":"nOBMaqGHHcM","viewCount":2448,"eventDate":"2020-08-29","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"voting-rights-for-all-global-hindu-ecosystems-nobmaqghhcm"}}
