Additionally today is the meaningful day of Mahalaya Amavasya in which ancestors are honored. Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains the importance of honoring our ancestors and forefathers. He will be performing Maheshwara Puja, leading devotees around the world into completion with their elders. \n\nCompletion with our forefathers is the best thing we can do for that being and ourselves \n\n– it brings us to a peaceful inner space.\n\nYou Can Bring Peace to Your Ancestors\nCompletion Goes Beyond This Life\nCompletion Beyond Our Earthly Bounds\nRelease Your Loved Ones From Suffering\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome  all of you with My love and respects.\n\nSpecially, today, is Completion with all the people who left the body, so in Thiruvanamalai, we do the installation and main abhishekam of my pre-monastic father and his mother; my father and grandmother's samadhi in Thiruvannamalai, in stone for both of them with Shivalinga installed, today it is getting the abhishekam, the first pooja is being done, and from today, we will be celebrating two Brahmotsavam's: one, Navaratri Brahmotsavan, Navaratri Uttsava, and Venkateshwara Uttsava, both events are starting! So the time of celebration, from today, the festival season is starting! Venkateshwara, and His Brahmotsava. Let Me expand on the Completion with forefathers.\nUnderstand, whatever our elders have contributed to us, continues to stay within us, it's effect continues to prevail in us. Any Shradha, and Dharpana, any offering, given to our forefathers actually heals that part which remains in us; which we retain in our system. That part is healed, Completed, by giving Shradha to our forefathers and ancestors. We are not actually one body where only one person is our owner; we are actually like this Navaratri Golom only- so many people are sitting! Today Today, in the ashram there's Navaratri Goolo where all different deities, Gods, Masters, everyone is present. We are also like that, only! All our forefathers are present in us at some level. Little or more, they are all present in us. Completing with all of them is very important. Completion with all of them is a basic requirement where... Complete Completion with elders, ancestors, forefathers leads to a peaceful being and restful awareness. Kind of a overpowering restful awareness; please understand, you all will understand overpowering restlessness, where how much ever you try to be peaceful, you will be restless.\nIf you complete with your ancestors and forefathers, a overpowering restful awareness will happen in you, a peacefulness. That's a very powerful life. This overpowering restful awareness is such beautiful space, such a sweet space, such a nice space, in that overpowering restful awareness only the celebration starts! That is why first, we do Completion and achieve that overpowering restful awareness, then Chandi, Maha Devi, Maha Energy happens, to bless us all and the whole celebration starts, with Venkateshwara and Devi. Navaratri is one of the biggest festival in Hindu tradition, and it starts with Completion with Forefathers. From today, all our temples and ashrams also will be celebrating the Navaratri Uttsava. As basically we have many Shakta Temples.\nA tradition says even the great incarnations like Rama, Krishna and all, did Shradha, offering of pinganapana and Shradha, rituals for the ancestors. Rama Himself did shradha and Jatayu both. And all the even incarnations did all these rituals. In Thiruvannamalai, Mahadeva Himself does for one of His disciple,devotee, it's very strange; the king from Karnataka who built the main part of the temple asked Mahadeva the boon of a child, Mahadeva appears as a child and says, as per the Karma, you can't have the kid forever, you can only enjoy my presence as a child for some time. Then the king asks, I wanted a child only to do my last rites. Mahadeva commits with him and says,\nEND OF SATSANG:-\n\nThe ashram we will be having every day the different forms of Devi, will be decorated, Devi will be appearing in different forms and blessing all of us, and the Chandi Homa will be happening, Durga Pooja will be happening, as usual. All the festivities will be happening. I wanted to complete with you all, the Venkateshwara Brahmotsava will be happening the 26th, but not today, it is not today; as it is celebrated in Thirupatti, we will be celebrating. Let's get ready to celebrate Devi's presence!\n\nCLICK for full TRANSCRIPTS:- http://nithyananda.org/video/completion-ancestors-0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XkXQG_kVXk/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"0XkXQG_kVXk","viewCount":5100,"eventDate":"2014-09-24","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"completion-with-ancestors-0xkxqgkvxk"}}
