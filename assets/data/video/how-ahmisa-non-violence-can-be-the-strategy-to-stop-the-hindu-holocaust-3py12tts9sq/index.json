DHARMA MEANS ‘COSMIC LAW’. THE ULTIMATE COSMIC LAW IS ‘AHIMSA’ - NONVIOLENCE. IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL, BEST STRATEGY, EVEN TO STOP THE HINDU HOLOCAUST.\n\n*I TALK AFTER THOROUGHLY TUNING MYSELF TO PARAMASHIVA. LITERALLY PARAMASHIVA IS UTTERING EVERY WORD I AM UTTERING. EVEN THE FULL STOP, COMMA, PAUSE, EVERYTHING IS DIRECTLY HIS, INCLUDING THE BODY LANGUAGE. HE IS JUST USING THIS MUSCLE MEMORY, BIOMEMORY, BIOENERGY, TO MANIFEST WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. I AM VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I AM TALKING.\n\n*LET ME FIRST MAKE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND HOW I ADOPT AHIMSA - NONVIOLENCE - FOR RELATIONSHIP WITH ME AND WITH MY GURU, RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FIRST TEAM, WITH MY SANGHA, WITH MY DISCIPLES AND DEVOTEES, WITH PRACTISING HINDUS, WITH THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, WITH THE WHOLE HUMANITY, WITH EVERYTHING….\n\n*IF YOU KNOW HOW I FUNCTION, YOU WILL BECOME ENLIGHTENED. KRISHNA IS THE GREATEST STRATEGIST BASED ON THE PARAMA DHARMA. FOOLS AND STUPIDS AND ANTI-HINDUS ARE THOSE WHO CLAIM KRISHNA MADE MAHABHARATA. KRISHNA PERSONALLY WENT TO NEGOTIATE PEACE AND HE WAS ABUSED. KRISHNA KNOWS HE WILL BE ABUSED, THAT MAY BE ABUSED WHEN HE GOES FOR NEGOTIATING PEACE. BUT STILL HE TOOK THE RISK. HE WAS NOT ONLY ABUSED, THERE WAS MURDER ATTEMPT ON KRISHNA.\n\nRead More Details at: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/3836924619728693\n\nREFERENCES: \n1.

We often believe that exacting revenge is a form of emotional release and that getting retribution will help us feel better. Movies often portray the act of revenge as a way of gaining closure after a wrong. But in fact, revenge has the opposite effect.  https://www.scienceofpeople.com/the-psychology-of-revenge/","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3PY12ttS9SQ/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"3PY12ttS9SQ","viewCount":2981,"eventDate":"2020-05-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"29"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"how-ahmisa-non-violence-can-be-the-strategy-to-stop-the-hindu-holocaust-3py12tts9sq"}}
