When we experience insecurity because of disagreements over finances, we do not have a true love relationship. The love center has not fully opened and we have created instead an arrangement of convenience. Once we fall truly in love, the concept of money becomes irrelevant to us. Money loses its significance, because we feel fulfilled at so profound a depth in our lives. Before we can experience divine love, the highest love, we first need to open ourunderstanding of human love. Once we encounter the shift from security to fulfillment at the human level, we can expand to the awareness of divine love.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nQ.1.  Money is becoming a huge problem in our relationship. I think my boyfriend spends too much. Meanwhile, I've been accused of being \"stingy\" and \"unrealistic.\" How can we resolve these conflicts and develop a \"team strategy\" in the area of finance? -- Victoria, Oklahoma, USA\n\nVictoria, first thing I am surprised seeing the question. It used to be always the other way! Men are supposed to be stingy, women are supposed to be spending and men usually complain women spend. I am very happy that the problem is the other way. Second thing, understand the whole question shows the shallowness you have in relationship. Understand, Victoria, when you are really in love or relationship, suddenly, money becomes useless. Please understand, this is the scale I am giving you to find out whether you are in love or not. Suddenly money will look fake and useless. Suddenly it will not matter to your life anymore. If you feel that, only then you are in love. Understand, I am not saying when you are in love, you will throw away all the money, gold, everything in the streets. No. Suddenly your thought is not centered anymore on money. It is centered on the other person. I have seen all my ashramites going through that sweet space. That is one of the best thing that can happen to a human being. You should experience that space at least once in your life where money just suddenly loses its power over you. I am seeing hundreds of my Ashramites donating crores worth of their wealth, without even thinking twice. See if they are struggling to donate, I'll know very clearly. They don't even think twice.\n\nWhen you are in love, I tell you, suddenly money loses its power over you. Victoria, I don't think you are in love or he is in love; maybe this is some convenient arrangement. I always used to tell a story of a prostitute and taxi driver. One taxi driver, in the middle of the night picks up a girl and drives her to some remote area, then does whatever he wants .Finally, she says, at the end of everything, \"give me 200$; I am a call girl\". This fellow gives the 200$, brings her back to the city and says, \"give me 200$; I am a taxi driver.\" Maybe the relationship you have - you need to re-think, revisit, review. Somewhere it is the arrangement of convenience, not love. There is no relationship. Because, when you are in love, suddenly the concept of money will not be there for both. I think he is in love with you, but you are not in love with him. Victoria, you need to look little deep.\n\nMan has only two centric thinking - 1. Money centric, 2. fulfillment centric. When you are in love, the fulfillment center is awakened, it wakes up and it does not let you think about money, it does not let you think about future security. I always tell people - even if you have one question about your future security, you are not in love, you have not experienced love. I have told many times to my own Ashramites, even though I don't accept or take their properties. If they feel their property is their future security, I tell them the Guru disciple relationship has not flowered, forget about it, still, you need to go a long way. So causally, they are able to give up everything. I have seen very funny things. They will give up crores of their property to me without even thinking second time, saying \"this is for Swamiji\". Understand this one thing, when your love is awakened, suddenly you think fulfillment based, and insecurity gives way.\n\nAfter that, you struggle with some other patterns. That is different. But, when you are a in love, when the guru disciple relationship starts, this giving up happens. I tell you, even between husband and wife, when love flowers, even between boyfriend and girlfriend, when real love flowers, suddenly the concept of future, insecurity, all that becomes meaningless. That is why there are thousands of decisions which you take when you are in love, which you repent for. Because, when the love disappears, you repent for all those decisions. With the master when you are in love, whatever decisions you take, you feel happy about it, because continuously you break all other patterns. When you break more and more of your patterns,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cRl10YvA3ns/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"cRl10YvA3ns","viewCount":7707,"eventDate":"2012-04-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"7"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"love-destroys-fear-how-to-resolve-relationship-issues-concerning-money-and-finance-crl10yva3ns"}}
