BLISS IS GOOD PUJA.\n\nJUST NOW I FINISHED ARUDRA NATARAJA ABHISHEKAM. NATARAJA RECEIVES 6 ABHISHEKAMS IN A YEAR. THIS IS THE FIRST ABHISHEKAM. ONE YEAR IS ONE KAALA IN DEVA LOKA. 6 ABHISHEKAMS ARE DONE IN DEVA LOKA.\n\nUPASANA IS LITERALLY SAMIPYA MUKTHI AND SARUPYA MUKTI MERGERS INTO SAYUJYA MUKTHI. INTENSE PRAYER MAY START AS VISHISHTA DVAITA, EVOLVE TO DVAITA, AND MANIFEST AS SHUDDHADVAITA. WHATEVER LEVEL IT IS, PRAYER IS THE MOST POWERFUL ULTIMATE WAY OF CONNECTING WITH PARAMASHIVA. INTENSE PRAYER. INTENSE PRAYER. INTENSE PRAYER!\n\nCONNECT WITH PARAMASHIVA. TODAY, A GREAT DAY! NATARAJA’S FIRST ABHISHEKAM. IN ALL KAILAASA, PUJA, NAIVEDHYAM, ABHISHEKAM, AARATI ARE BEING OFFERED TO NATARAJA.\n\nALL SHIVA TEMPLES SHOULD HAVE THESE 4 DEITIES, IT IS A COMPULSORY: MAIN SHIVA LINGA, DAKSHINAMOORTHY IN THE PRAKARAM; SOUTH FACING. THIRD - LINGOTBAVAR WEST FACING. FOURTH; NATARAJA SOUTH FACING.\n\nALL OUR TEMPLES SHOULD INSTALL ALL THESE 4 DEITIES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. ONE OF THE SINCERE NATARAJA TEMPLE WE ARE RUNNING IS TAMBARAM KAILAASA. VERY SINCERE AND AUTHENTIC DEVOTEES. AND OF COURSE, SEATTLE - WORLD’S ONE OF THE LARGEST AND TALLEST NATARAJA MOORTHY IS INSTALLED IN SHRIKAILASA OF SEATTLE. KOZHIKODE AADHEENAM AND ALANGULAM AADHEENAM ALSO HAS NATARAJA AS MAIN DEITY.\n\nTODAY, WE ARE HAVING NATARAJA ABHISHEKAM AND PUJA. LIFE IS COSMIC DANCE! NOTHING COMPARED TO THE BEAUTY OF COSMIC DANCE. MOST POWERFUL MANIFESTATION OF PARAMASHIVA IS NATARAJA. DOING PANCHAKRITYA WITH BLISS. LET’S MEDITATE ON THAT FORM. CONNECT WITH NATARAJA, PARAMASHIVA HIMSELF IN THE FORM OF NATARAJA!\n\nTHIS IS THE BOON FOR ALL MY DISCIPLES, YOU WILL EXPERIENCE NATARAJA NOW! NATARAJA IS REAL. HE IS THE COSMIC DAY. HE IS THE COSMOS. LET’S CONNECT WITH HIM WITH MAHAVAKYA. OM NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVOHAM.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/vsaqUVbiY5k/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"vsaqUVbiY5k","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"bliss-is-good-puja-vsaquvbiy5k"}}
