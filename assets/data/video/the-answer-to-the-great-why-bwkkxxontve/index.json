Why do we need to meditate? Why is kriya necessary? Why do our sangha acharyas teach the four principles? Nithyananda tells us that there is no definitive answer to the Why of the universe. Any why must be answered by the questioners themselves. As we understand deeper spiritual mysteries the answer becomes self-evident: we grasp it without explanation. This answer is different for each individual; and as we increase in our level of maturity and awareness, even the same answer evolves and changes.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday's subject for Nithya Satsangh: THE ANSWER FOR THE GREAT \"WHY?\"!\nThis big WHY? WHY? WHY?! This is the first stone you face in the life. You can take this stone as obstruction and never move beyond it. Or you can use this stone as a stepping stone and start going up. Or you can use this stone even to take off!\n\nThis great 'WHY?'! Please understand whatever is said and done, human-beings can move only with this ability to handle the great 'WHY?' If you are not able to answer to this great 'WHY?', if you are not able to convince yourself for this 'WHY?' you will continuously suffer lack of inspiration, energy, laziness, boredom. \n\nI tell you, the worst things can happen to human-beings is laziness attack, boredom attack. People talk about panic attack. No! I tell you, boredom attack and laziness attack is more costly than panic attack.\n\nPanic attack happens to you if you have too many answers for 'WHY?'\n\nBoredom attack happens to you if you don't have answer for 'WHY?'\n\nLaziness attack happens to you if you don't even want to know the answer for 'WHY?'! \n\n3:23\n\nThe great 'WHY?' which created philosophies, gave birth to principles, gave birth even to gods, goddesses, gave birth to religions, gave birth to spiritual groups, cults, sects, cultures, we will today indulge on this great 'WHY?'\n\nI have a news. You can take it as a good news or a bad news. For this great 'WHY?' you have to discover answer. It can be a good news if you are interested in finding the answer. It can be bad news if you think, 'Oh, I have to find out! Nobody else will give me the answer!'\n\nI tell you, with Integrity and Authenticity I tell you, please do not accept anybody's answer for the 'WHY?' If you accept my answer for 'WHY?' you may be living for my answer. At the most, my answer can be an inspiration for you to find out the answer for 'WHY?'\n\n(HINDI)\n\nThis 'WHY?' created religions, made many people reach their peak and killed many people brutally in religious terrorism. For the religious terrorism to spiritual enlightenment, for the whole -- see, one end of the spectrum is religious terrorism, one end of the spectrum is spiritual enlightenment -- for both, \"WHY?\" is a reason. If you don't find the answer for \"WHY?\" and eat somebody else's answer, you can even be made as a religious terrorist! If you find your own answer for the \"WHY?\" you will become spiritually enlightened! \n\nThis great \"WHY?\" this was the yesterday's discussion with me and my, I can say that top organizers of Dhyanapeetam who run my sangha literally. I was having discussion. \n\nAll of them asked, 'We need to answer this one question, Swamiji, \"WHY?\"! \n\nSo, I contemplated, contemplated, contemplated on it. I told them straightaway, 'Now I don't have answer. I will get back to you.'\n\nThanks to the disciples who give me the space to say, \"I don't know\", understand, it is a; it is not greatness of me; it is the greatness of my disciples! They are ready for an answer of this sort from me that 'I don't know! I will get back to you guys!' Of course, I have started contemplating, meditating, and I can see the answer is evolving. \n\nThey were asking me, 'Why these four tattwas? Why meditation? Why kriya? Why all this?'\n\nWe go on teach people 'HOW': how to live the four tattwas; how to do the kriya. But still we have yet to answer this great question of \"WHY?\"\n\nIf you say health, for health reason do the kriyas,\n\n'Why health? Why not die with disease? Why health?' \n\nNo, the wealth! 'Why wealth?' \n\nNo, relationship! 'Why relationship?' \n\nThis \"WHY?\" has to be answered! \n\nSome of the ashramites were trying to give pseudo answers: 'No, no no! No, this, that!'\n\nI said, 'No! Let us be very clear. I am very clear I don't know the answer. I will get back.'\n\nI literally sat on it! From yesterday, after the discussion, one great thing with my mind or no mind is, any problem, till it blossoms into solution, it sits on it! It will not get diverted by anything. Nothing can divert it, even the sleep, including sleep. \nListen! Including sleep if you can't be diverted from the problem till you find solution, you are called \"Genius\"! I am defining \"Genius\". \n\nGreat mathematician, Ramanujan, if you have heard of this Ramanujan, just few days before, some of the mathematics professors have proved his theories, theorems, his solutions which he found hundred years before, as true.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwKkxxOntVE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBLcege9qYMR3DjSZDhiu3zBM5UAQ","youtubeID":"bwKkxxOntVE","viewCount":2928,"eventDate":"2013-05-10","duration":3290,"likeCount":78,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"24"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-answer-to-the-great-why-bwkkxxontve"}}
