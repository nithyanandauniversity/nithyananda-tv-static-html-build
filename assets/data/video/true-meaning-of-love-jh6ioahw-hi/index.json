Nithyananda says that after spiritual experience comes Bhakti and social service. It is not the other way. Only a person who had the experience of every being, as part of the cosmic consciousness, only he can know and radiate love. Words and deeds, however trivial those may seem, of an Enlightened Master always do good to everyone. On the other hand the words and deeds, however great those may be, of an un-Enlightened person bring misery. For example, a simple instruction such as \"Watch your Breath\" from Buddha helped thousands to experience the Consciousness whereas the \"Theory of Relativity\" led to the invention of Atomic Bomb.
