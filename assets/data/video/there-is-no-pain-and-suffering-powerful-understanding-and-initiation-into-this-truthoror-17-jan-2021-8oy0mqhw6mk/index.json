YOU WILL BECOME ENLIGHTENED AND START MANIFESTING POWERS NOW IMMEDIATELY. \n\n*I AM NOT PLAYING WITH YOUR GREED, I AM PLAYING WITH YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\n*THESE ARE THE FIVE SUTRAS. I AM GOING TO REVEAL ONLY THE SUTRAS. DOING KANDANA MANDANA AND ESTABLISHING THE POWERFULNESS OF THE SUTRAS ON IT IS THE JOB OF THE BHASHYAKARAS, MY  SAMPRADAYA, MY DISCIPLES.\n\n*SUTRA 1 - THE PERSON, BEING, WHO IS BOLD ENOUGH TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFERING AND PAIN IN YOUR LIFE EVEN IF YOUR MIND BRAINWASHES YOU AND FORCES YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SUFFERING EXISTS, IN FRONT OF THAT MIND, IF YOU BOLDLY STAND AND TERRORISE THAT MIND BY YOUR POWERFUL WAY OF DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFERING, YOU BECOME THE SPACE OF MAHA KALABHAIRAVA AND NO KARMA TOUCHES YOU AND YOU ESTABLISH YOURSELF IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE CALLED NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI.\n\n*POWERFULLY, IF NEEDED ARROGANTLY, ILLOGICALLY, EVEN IT FEELS STUPID, WITH TREMENDOUS PRIDE, DECLARE YOUR PARAMASHIVATVA. TERRORISE YOUR MIND BY DENYING THE SUFFERING AND PAIN. BE POWERFUL.\n\n*JUST DENY TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING.\n\n*DO NOT LOOK FOR SOLUTION, FOR COMPROMISED UNDERSTANDING, QUICK RELIEF OR ALTERNATIVE METHODS. \n\n*FOR ALL MY DISCIPLES FOR WHOM I AM TRUTH, TRUTH, TRUTH, NOTHING BUT TRUTH, SATYA, I AM GIVING YOU THIS INITIATION. \n\n*YOU WILL ALL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS INITIATION AND TRUTH.\n\n*DECIDE TO TREAT YOUR MIND OR ANY ONE EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU / BRAINWASH YOU, THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERING OR PAIN, VERY CHEAPLY, LIKE SH*T. \n\n*MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION. DECIDE: ‘EVEN IF I AM TERRORISED BY PAIN AND SUFFERING, I WILL STAND BY MY GURUVAK THAT PAIN AND SUFFERING DOES NOT EXIST,’ \n\n*EVEN IF YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY THE LAVA / MOLTEN STONE, DECLARE, ‘MY GURU HAS TOLD THERE IS NO PAIN OR SUFFERING.’ \n\n*I WILL THROW MY JATA FOR YOU TO HOLD AND LIFT YOU TO KAILASA!\n\n*DEMONSTRATE YOUR POWERFULNESS EVEN IF IT LOOKS LIKE ARROGANCE IN FRONT OF THE DELUSION THAT IS TRYING TO BRAINWASH YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERING AND PAIN.\n\n*WHEN YOU DENY OUTRIGHT THE EXISTENCE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, THE WHOLE CHANGE HAPPENS IN YOUR SYSTEM, CREATES SPACE FOR PARAMASHIVA.\n\n*SUDDENLY YOU WILL SEE, THE UNIVERSE IS MOVING AROUND YOU AND YOU ARE THE CENTER. \n\n*LOOK FOR PEACE, YOU WILL ENJOY BLISS. \n\n*DON'T LOOK FOR BLISS, YOU WILL ALWAYS LAND IN HOPELESSNESS. \n\n*UNDERSTAND THIS FIRST SUTRA. \n\n*WHEN I SAY, ‘DENY PAIN AND SUFFERING,’ I AM NOT SAYING LOOK FOR BLISS AND JOY. LOOK FOR PEACE. \n\n*DENY PAIN, SUFFERING AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE - NOT THEIR REASONS AND CAUSES, NO! \n\n*SH*T IS SH*T IS SH*T. THE BEAUTY, THE GOOD NEWS IS, SH*T DOES NOT EXIST. \n\n*’PAIN IS SH*T’ MAY NOT BE GOOD NEWS. BUT ‘THE SH*T CALLED PAIN DOES NOT EXIST’, IS GOOD NEWS. \n\n*THIS ONE SUTRA CAN GIVE ENLIGHTENMENT TO ALL MY DISCIPLES NOW, THIS VERY MOMENT! \n\n*YOU CAN START MANIFESTING POWERS THIS VERY MOMENT. \n\n*JUST DECIDE, ‘I DENY THE EXISTENCE OF ANY FORM OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ME.’ \n\n*DECIDE: ‘I AM NOT INTERESTED IN EVEN RECOGNISING THE EXISTENCE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, FORGET ABOUT THE CAUSES.’ \n\n*IF YOU DON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF THAT SH*T, WHY WILL YOU TRY TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THAT SH*T?\n\n*DENIAL OF PAIN AND SUFFERING GIVES YOU ONE OF THE GREATEST OPENINGS TO LOOK INTO THE REALITY.\n\n*I AM NOT TEACHING THIS AS A TECHNIQUE FOR YOU TO PRACTICE BUT REVEALING THIS AS A TRUTH FOR YOU TO WAKE UP. \n\n*BEING MY DISCIPLE, YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUFFER OR HAVE PAIN.\n\n*EITHER BE MY DISCIPLE AND RENOUNCE THE RIGHT TO HAVE SUFFERING AND PAIN, OR MARRY THE PAIN AND SUFFERING AND DROP ME! \n\n*DECISION TO DENY THE PAIN, SUFFERING AND ITS VERY EXISTENCE IN ANY FORM, IS THE PURE NEUTRAL SPACE, NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI IN YOU. \n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4793343310753481\n\n\n\nGet Your Free E-Passport at join.kailaasa.org and receive all the gifts to live enlightenment!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Oy0mQhW6mk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"8Oy0mQhW6mk","viewCount":3288,"eventDate":"2021-01-18","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"there-is-no-pain-and-suffering-powerful-understanding-and-initiation-into-this-truthoror-17-jan-2021-8oy0mqhw6mk"}}
