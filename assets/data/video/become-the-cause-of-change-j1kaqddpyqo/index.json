To achieve complete completion, we need to complete with all the layers of karma that we carry. It is not enough to simply follow a spiritual path, practicing completion as we remember throughout the day. Even making completion a priority is inadequate. We need to eat, sleep, breath, and live it! It must be the only priority in our lives! A Sannyas is a person who is making completion the only priority in life!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday, we have a special Chief Guest, Swami Atmanandaji Maharaj from Kanavaipudur.  Swamiji is a direct disciple of Swami Chidbhavananda. Swami Chidbhavananda is South India's Vivekananda.  Swami Chidbhavananda has contributed so much. I don't want to introduce Swami Chidbhavananda to all of you, because I have already spoken about Swami Chidbhavananda many times in our satsanghs. The whole Bhagavad Gita satsanghs our satsang and book I have dedicated to Swami Chidbhavananda, because I read Bhagavad Gita first time from Swami Chidbhavananda's Tamil translation. So even though I have never met Swami Chidbhavananda directly, he was a great inspiration for me.  \n\nSwami is a direct disciple of Swami Chidbhavananda and Swamiji has also created huge organizations. Actually, Swamiji's the creator of whole Karur in and around organisations in Karur and area. All the educational institutions now owned by Tapovanam has been created by Swamiji and at present Swamiji is the President of the Sharada Niketan Trust. He heads education institutions and he also has many schools where thousands of students are getting free education.  Swamiji's a powerful orator, teacher and a great sadhu.  He has initiated many Sannyasis and Sannyasinis and created many institutions for his brother disciples.  Above all, an important thing for Dhyanapeetam our sangha should know Swamiji is the first person who gave money for Dhyanapeetam.  \n\nIn 2001 January, now I think twelve, thirteen years before, , twelve years before when the Erode devotees gathered together and wanted to donate land to me, I said, 'I will go to Nerur Sadashiva Brahmendra's samadhi and take the blessings and come.  Then we will start the ashram.'  I went to Nerur to have Sadashiva Brahmendra's samadhi's darshan and blessings, then on the way I went to Swamiji Atmanandaji's ashram and I took blessings from Swamiji also. I asked Swamiji to bless.  I said, 'Swamiji, now I have completed my parivrajaka yatra. Now I am going to settle down in one place. Few devotees are giving a small land in Erode. I am going to start staying there but I don't know where I wanted the ashram to be but I am going to be staying in Erode.' The moment he heard that immediately Swamiji gave the first donation. Still the receipt we have. So in a way Swamiji started Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam.  It is, the whole Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam is initiated, started by Swamiji.  \n\nThen please understand, it is not what amount is important, but the attitude of giving. That is the first thing.  Swamiji is such a compassionate, loving and giving sadhu. And not only the money, the blessings he gave. Please understand, now after our huge success, suddenly so many people claim that I belong to them, I belong to them, I belong to them I belong to them, but it is actually Swamiji who started the whole Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam. So actually, the money with which Swamiji gave, with that only we registered that land. Registration of that land happened with the money Swamiji gave and now you know, rest is history. And throughout the thin and thick times, Swamiji always stood by us, supported us, blessed us and today Swamiji is here to bless all of us.\n\nI requested Swamiji to speak few words but Swamiji said it is okay. But, on behalf of me and Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam, I offer our humble respects to Swamiji. Then I'll continue the satsangh.\n\n06:48 - 12:03 Swamiji Atmanandaji Maharaj's address in Tami\n \nTranslator:\n\nNithyanandam, the translation of the blessing message Swami Atmananda Maharaj. Swamiji belongs to the same parampara, the heredity of Sri Ramakrishna. Indeed Swamiji is now decorating, adorning the sacred seat which was previously adorned by the group of Sri Ramakrishna, totapuri .By God's grace Swamiji took birth. Right from the young age Swamiji has been doing so much pious and enriching work to society and the whole world. With spirituality in India, showing the world Swamiji is doing that work. From young age he received God's grace and is doing the great work and accomplishments. If you have God's grace all good thoughts and wishes will get fulfilled. Swamiji has established centres across the world and spread spirituality. When we are talking, when we both were talking yesterday, he said the number of Sannyasis and Sanyasanis in Dhyanapeetam if we see we don't even have one Sannyasi per city. Swamiji wants to create at least 10 lakh Sannyasis in India.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1kAQDDPyQo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLD-rNUhQxoJkw8SQ_Rf49LgfnUhlA","youtubeID":"j1kAQDDPyQo","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"become-the-cause-of-change-j1kaqddpyqo"}}
