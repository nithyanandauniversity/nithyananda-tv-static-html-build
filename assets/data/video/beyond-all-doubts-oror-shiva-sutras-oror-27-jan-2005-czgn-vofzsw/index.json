Here, we are hearing the discussion between Swamiji and the audience as they attempt to find an answer to the question: ‘What constitutes seed?’ Through a series of questions and answers, His Divine Holiness leads us to a better understanding of this concept.\n\nHis Divine Holiness begins with sharing how the 7 wonders of the world are related to each cakra. An in-depth explanation is given on how different philosophies have answered the question: “What constitutes seed?” in relation to each cakra (energy center). There are 6 philosophies from the root center (Muladhara) to the brow center (Ajna cakra). For the seventh energy center, the Crown center (Sahasrara) there is no philosophy. Paramashiva gives you the straight technique so your own experience can give you the answer to the question: “What constitutes seed?” \n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
