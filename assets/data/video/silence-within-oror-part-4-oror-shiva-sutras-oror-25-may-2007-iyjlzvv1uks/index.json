Nothing can shake us. When we cannot allow words to go thru and we bounce words(sound) back on others, then that forms karma chakra. We can use this as Meditation Technique. Not stopping the words coming towards us in our life and not give meaning to it. Use words to center inside and allow the words to flow thru us without resisting. This will surely provide path to liberation. We should use every situation in life as an opportunity to liberate. If we are hurt by master’s words, then we are standing with a big ego. Even Life is a great master. We should allow words to pass through us without we getting hurt. Then life can be a great master giving liberation.\nPart 1- https://youtu.be/4H0sa9m9EpA\nPart 2- https://youtu.be/Id8EqNKoOKI\nPart 3- https://youtu.be/i2M7V_1_s7s\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
