Auspiciousness without reason or cause. When something exists without cause or reason, it's eternal. Even if you look at the extraordinary qualities of Mahadeva, when he sits in silence he puts people into enlightenment. Under the banyan tree, Dakshinamurty; when he dances, he puts people into bliss. Nataraja; when he destroys, he destroys all negativity. Kala Bairava; when he decides to show compassion, he can take any poison and swallow, no limit. When he decides to destroy, he will destroy even death, Yama. When he decides to save, he will go to any extent to save others, how he swallowed the poison to save the world, risking himself, his own body.\"\n\"The grandeur with which he expresses the experience, he showers on people who even remember him, Sadhashiva, the ultimate Guru , ultimate Yogi, ultimate King, Eeshwara, ultimate Leader, ultimate Bliss, ultimate compassion, ultimate life. With all these qualities, he is not too far away, very easy to approach, easily pleased. Nothing much is required to please him. That is why he's called Bole Baba, easily pleased.\"\n\n\"Today is the celebration of Shiva appearing as an eternal light shaft as Arunachala. Today is the day intense cosmic energy radiates. He enters the physical plane as a master, in the body, for people to experience all the auspicious qualities experienced as life and not just as a belief. He is the charmer of the Kundalini snake. He can play with the Kundalini snake which resides in every being.\"\n\n\"Today is the day we are supposed to constantly dive into the qualities of Mahadeva. Shiva is filled with Ananda kalyana guna, thousands and thousands of auspicious qualities, so I'm picking up 7 qualities for you to contemplate on:\n1. Fantasy less being\n2. Being beyond fear\n3. Being without worries\n4. Sharing giving always giving\n5. A being who's unique\n6. So simple and easily available\n7. Being in eternal fulfillment , Nithyananda\"\nNithyananda encouraged us all to dedicate this day towards our inner self. No outer world work, the whole day, only contemplate on these 7 qualities. Go on repeating the Mahamantra, the great mantra, the sacred sound, \"Om Nama Shivaya.\"\n\nIn preparation for the Kundalini awakening in the evening, he gave these 3 instructions:\nFast, drinking only bale juice or coconut water, \nRemember the auspicious qualities of Mahadeva,\nAnd finally repeat the sacred sound Om Nama Shivaya, \n\n\"Today we observe another important thing, the day to destroy collective negativity. I'll initiate all of you into the intense Kundalini experience now today for the whole day so that at night you can explode like Shiva and stand as a cosmic light being.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MguE6QLOeK0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA7PGoGsVQtMv02QhHKfaEYYIOJdQ","youtubeID":"MguE6QLOeK0","viewCount":18100,"eventDate":"2011-03-02","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"7"},{"id":"11"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"qualities-of-shiva-shiva-ratri-message-1-by-nithyananda-2-mar-2011-mgue6qloek0"}}
