KEEP IN SUCH A WAY IN ONE MIRROR YOUR FACE WILL REFLECT, IN ANOTHER MIRROR, THIS WORLD WILL REFLECT…\n\n*IN REALITY BOTH MIRRORS ARE MIRRORING DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS, FACES OF YOU. HOW MUCH YOU FEEL YOU ARE YOUR BODY, HOW MUCH THAT IS TRUE, MORE THAN THAT “YOU ARE COSMOS” IS TRUE.\n\n*YOU ARE VERILY THE CORE AND SOURCE OF THIS COSMOS CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\n*IT IS JUST LIKE HOW PARAMASHIVA HAS 25 FACES, YOU EXPERIENCING YOUR BODY AS YOU, IS ONE PHASE / FACE OF YOU;\n\n*YOU EXPERIENCING YOUR MIND AS YOU IS ONE PHASE/FACE OF YOU;\n\n*YOU EXPERIENCING YOUR DEEP SLEEP STATE IS ONE PHASE/FACE OF YOU;\n\n* YOU KNOWING THAT THIS WHOLE COSMOS IS YOU, IS ONE PHASE/FACE OF YOU.\n\n*IF YOU RECOGNIZE MY IDENTITY AS PARAMASHIVA, YOU WILL RECOGNIZE YOUR IDENTITY AS PARAMASHIVA.\n\n* IF YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR IDENTITY AS PARAMASHIVA, ONE OF THE FACES OF YOU IS PARAMASHIVA, YOU WILL SIMPLY RECOGNISE I AM PARAMASHIVA!\n\n*LIVING EITHER AS SHIVAYA NAMAHA OR SHIVOHAM, BOTH ARE OK, BUT THIS IS LIFE.

ALL THE KAILAVASIS, SANYASIS, BRAHMACHARIS SHOULD MEMORISE THE VERSES AND TRANSLATION.\n\n*CHANT THE TRANSLATION. IT CAN GET INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND BECOME YOUR THOUGHT CURRENT. WE CAN HAVE BHAGAVAD GITA JNANA YAJNA EVERYDAY. EVERYDAY, CHANT ONE CHAPTER. IT DOES NOT TAKE MORE THAN 10 MINUTES. IN 18 DAYS YOU WILL FINISH. MAY BE 18TH OR 2ND CHAPTER MAY TAKE 40 MINS, THAT'S ALL.\n\n*BHAGAVAD GITA IS ABSOLUTELY QUALIFIED TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN INTRODUCTION BOOK TO HINDUISM. SURELY WHOLE HINDUISM CANNOT BE CONTAINED IN ONE BOOK, BUT IT IS AN AMAZING INTRODUCTION TO HINDUISM.\n\n*WHEN RAMA THE GREAT INCARNATION HAPPENED, HE CONSOLIDATED ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS THERE AT THAT TIME AS MUKTIKOPANISHAD, AS 108 CHAPTERS. LIKE BHAGAVAD GITA HAS 18 CHAPTERS, THE MUKTIKOPANISHAD HAS 108 CHAPTERS THAT RAMA HAS COMPILED.\n\n* MA MUKTIKA, TAKE UP THIS RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS 108 UPANISHAD CHANTING.
