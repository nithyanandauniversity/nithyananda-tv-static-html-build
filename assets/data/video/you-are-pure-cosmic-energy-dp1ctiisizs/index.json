The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 24, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamji) presents the most repeated verse of the entire Gita. This verse is recited in in every Hindu monastery and by every saddhu before taking any food or water. The sacred secret hidden within it is that what we eat, drink and breathe is cosmos, the mouth we eat and breathe through is cosmos, how we digest the cosmos is also cosmos, and what we return from our inner cosmos into the outer cosmos is -- cosmos as well! We do not own any part of the cycle. Food or air, mouth, digestion, exhalation -- everything is simply cosmos. Paramahamsa informs us that meditation on this technique can lead to instant enlightenment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagawad Gita, jnana karma sanyasa yoga chapter 4, verse 24\n\nBefore entering into the satsang, I wanted to share a unique experience happened just now in me. Usually I sit there, they show the aarti here, it just doesn't hit you. So personally, today I was sitting here, just in front of my eyes, doing the aarti. See when I am there, first thing I slip into superconcious zone..by the time aarti comes pada puja is already happening ....I cannot sit quietly more than 2 to 3 minutes, either I have to be in Samadhi, without mind or making people loose mind.  Either, if I am in samadhi, you are saved, if I am not in Samadhi I drive you to Samadhi, thats my life. Naturally, morning means I will be sitting there, by the time aarti comes, I am already in Samadhi I do not feel it is directly done to me.\n\nI have never felt any pada puja done directly to me, by the time I come and sit, already I have so much respect for my padukas. Actually the moment I come and sit, first thing I bow down to my padukas. As I said once energized, they are independent of me, whether I live in the body or don't live in the body they can lead you to enlightenment. They are independent deity, but a common man cannot understand that I have so much respect and devotion for my padukas. They will say, \"oh, some one crazy\", they will try to find out what is this disorder called in psychology.  So I have so much devotion for my padukas, the moment I see them I bow down, I fall into Samadhi, even if I miss two three minutes looking around, blessing the people or greeting the person who has come to do pada puja, that arunagiri yogeshwara's dhyan shloka is there, that's automatic bumper:\n\nLalate tripundri shakit...  that's it, I immediately know, memory of aurnagiri yogishwara is too much, I will fall into Samadhi, I will never feel aarti is done to me, pada puja is done to me, never have the idea it is being done to me, just like you are also sitting and doing I am also sitting and, \" ok,  it is happening\".\n\nI know it is done to the intense presence of cosmos, the ultimate, but today just then I came and sat. I was looking around all these centers, missed aurnagiri yogishwara's dhyan shloka also, I have had this experience in those days when devotees called me to their houses and when I go there, they will do special pada puja and literally they will put camphor in my nose, and, \" te-te-te-te....i will slowly try to move back, aien...I will not leave you\", they will chase me and show me camphor. It is like just like that scene, that around the world atleast in 100s of places, people are worshipping with so much of sincerity, by the time, the second thought came, I had already slipped into Samadhi. There was no second thought. Just like that one idea came, \"oh god\". Because I could see the aarti today only I saw, how grand it looks in every temple when they show the huge maha aarti, because sitting there in the garbha mandir, I  can see what is going on,,but today it is too close. Usually my paduka is there, I will put the responsibility on paduka, ok it is done to the paduka what is there for me..today my paduka is also missing..it is not there.\n\nIn the vedic tradition Paduka is considered, padugai nachiar, means an independent devi, who can liberate people without even the consent of the master. It does not have any concern about right or wrong about the people, it doesn't judge. Padugai nachiar is presented as a devi, because only mother can liberate without judging. \n\nAnyhow, so paduka is also missing..i am giving exact insider's information, how I was feeling.   Suddenly I felt huge responsibility, for a moment, then I slipped into Samadhi. After the aarti was over I was trying to settle, because I have to now talk, means share, somethings with you guys,  satsang has to happen.\n\nI could see very clearly, that responsibility coming out as action.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dp1CTIIsIZs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA8P2sQJoeTxfG7oTjMNB53zf5DYg","youtubeID":"Dp1CTIIsIZs","viewCount":10789,"eventDate":"2012-04-11","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"you-are-pure-cosmic-energy-dp1ctiisizs"}}
