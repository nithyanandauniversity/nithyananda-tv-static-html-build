Saying “No” to life kills our atman or soul! We can combat negative qualities and patterns that drag us down, making our lives hell, by wielding the weapon of patience. Having tremendous patience with ourselves and others, moves us away from anger and violence into the space of Living, saying “Yes” to life. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI will enter into the third verse of Ishavasya Upanishad.  Please chant along with me:\n \nअसुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः ।\nताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥\nAsurya naama they lokaa andhena thamasaavruthaah |\nThaamsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah ||\n \nThe translation:\n \n‘The various abodes of the Asuras, the lower level existence, are in the form of inferior or lower grade worlds, which are like hells coerced by darkness, representing all the negative qualities, collectively called “thamas”.  Those who literally kill the Athma become ghosts who inhabit such horrible abodes, and, this, they continue to do repeatedly.’\n \nListen!  People who say “YES” to life, what will happen to them was described in the last verses.  Now, people who say “NO” to life, what will happen to them is getting described.\n \nListen!  Whenever you entertain “NO” to life, first, always, “NO” is entertained as frustration.  Then it evolves as anger, violence, self-doubt, self-hatred, self-denial; all this is various expressions.  But, it starts as frustration.  So, I tell you, one of the important qualities to say “YES” to life is tremendous patience.  Listen!  Tremendous patience!  YES!  YES!  YES!  Every time YES!  After every time, YES! \n \nListen!  Every time, when what you want does not happen, don’t say “NO”; end in “YES”.  I am not saying accept.  No! \n \nI will give you an example:\n \nIf something does not happen the way I want in our Sangha, I don’t accept and keep quiet.  But I don’t allow frustration.  I will do whatever needs to be done, and, end, I will say, ‘Alright!  Yes!’  Next, I will be again prepared with all the patience to move further, to do things further.  My disciples’ ignorance never made me reduce my plans, understand?  The people with whom you are living – first you, and everyone else around you – their ignorance or inability should not give you frustration, should not make you say “NO” to you.  Listen!  The moment you accept “NO, the moment you say “NO” to expansion, you have started saying “NO” to you!\n \n असुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृताः ।\nताँस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥\nAsurya naama they lokaa andhena thamasaavruthaah |\nThaagumsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah ||\n \nThe second line of the verse should not be chanted as “Thaasthey” (तास्ते).  That is “paatta bhedha”.  I heard, learnt, I heard from my acharyas as “Thaagumsthey”.  Even though the verse says just “Thaasthey” (तास्ते).  “Thaagumsthey”. Half “gum”.  Silent “gum”.  Thaagumsthey prethyabhigachchanthi ye ke chaathmahano janaah.\n \nListen!  Saying “NO” to you is the worst sin.  I have given you one example that “inability and ignorance of you and the people living around you cannot reduce your creativity or plans to express your peak possibility”.  This is one definition.  And multiple, I can give you multiple explanations, multiple understandings from various fronts.  Like, for example, your body gives pain at some parts of your body – headache or stomach pain.  Don’t shrink.  When that headache comes, stomach-ache comes, don’t add psychological suffering to it – ‘Oh, if this same continues, what will happen?  I am very young.\n\nLINK OF FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/only-ghosts-say-no-life#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/me714SUBFJk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"me714SUBFJk","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"only-ghosts-say-no-to-life-me714subfjk"}}
