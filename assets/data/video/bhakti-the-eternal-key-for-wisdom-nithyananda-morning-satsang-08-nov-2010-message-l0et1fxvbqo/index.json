He says Bhakti is the goal, it brings wisdom. He read a poem from the great mystic poet, Kabir: \nThe bhakti path winds in a delicate way\nOn this path there is no asking and no not asking \nThe ego simply disappears the moment you touch\nhim\nThe joy of looking for him is so immense that you\njust dive in \nand coast around like a fish in the water\nIf anyone needs a hand, the lover leaps up to offer \nhis.\n\nThe poem beautifully explains the gift of Bhakti. The ego simply disappears and is replaced by humbleness and deep patience.  If there is suffering, it is based on arrogance.  Swamiji warned viewers not be around him if you hold on to your suffering, it suffocates him.  Do not try to bring him to your level.  Just know he is the ultimate and disappear into him.\nKabir's poem on Bhakti reminds us that when you are truly in love with God, with Existence, you are ready to leap up to help anyone who needs help.  This is an extreme sacred sentiment. He advised everyone to just sit with this truth for the day and practice it.\nHe will deliver another sacred sentiment tomorrow.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nTodays subject is 'Bhakti - the eternal key for wisdom'. I can say wisdom - the eternal key for bhakti, because the goal is bhakti not wisdom. Wisdom is for bhakti. I will give you some of the sacred sentiments from these great devotees like Kabir and define the experience of bhakti.\n\nVery beautifully bhakti is described by Kabir. The bhakti winds in a delicate way. On this path there is no asking and no not asking. The ego simply disappears the moment you touch him. The joy of looking for him is so immense that you just dive in and coast around like a fish in water. If anyone needs a head, the lover leaps up to offer his. Yesterday one of our Ma rishi was asking, what's a difference between the non suffering and vyakulata; yearning. Kabir gives answer for this, that question.\n\nSee yesterday I was describing base of bhakti is non suffering. She was asking how can we differentiate the non suffering and vyakulata; yearning. Please understand, in yearning, vyakulata, you will never have hatred towards the Master or God. In suffering you have demands and when that demands are not met you will have a deep hatred, pain. You can't forgive him. Not only that even if he meets your demands you will feel, oh I am bound by him. I have to be independent of him. You will have hatred to him. I have seen people. If I don't meet their need they have hatred for me. If I say it's ok alright I will do what you want, even then, no I am independent of you. I don't want you to do that. Again they have hatred.\n\nUnderstand the difference between the non suffering and vyakulata. With vyakulata you will always melt you. With suffering you will try to melt the other person, try to change the other person. So non suffering is different, vyakulata is different. Please understand in vyakulata there will never be any hatred; yearning. There will never be any hatred. But in suffering you will start hating the other person, the pain for. You will start abusing, blaming the other person. So understanding of the non suffering and vyakulata is very important.\n\nHere Kabir very clearly says there is no asking and no not asking; no asking no not asking. In vyakulata you neither ask and it not that you never ask. With suffering you ask and even if he fulfills, you are not fulfilled. And I have seen the arrogant people; they don't even want to receive when I give. No it is not necessary, because I begged you are giving, I don't want to take that. Fools! With suffering, suffering is always based on arrogance and vyakulata is based on humbleness. Here the Kabir is describing vyakulata, no asking and no not asking; means you don't ask and it is not mean, it does not mean you don't accept when it is showered on you. It is such a deep humbleness and passiveness; a deep patience.\n\nYou see with vyakulata you don't feel he is human; equal to you. But with suffering you start feeling he is equal to you. That is why always I tell people, if you are suffering you don't have love for me. You bring me to your level. You try to bring me to your level. Your arrogance, you try to raise, you try to think you are equalent to me and you bring me to your level. With vyakulata you always know he is ultimate and you just only try to disappear into me, try to dissolve into the Master or God.\n\nThe bhakti path winds in a delicate way. On this path there is no asking and no not asking.  Kabir's answer for difference between non suffering; Kabir is making you understand more clearly on non suffering and vyakulata. The ego simply disappears the moment you touch him. The joy of looking for him is so immense that you just dive in and coast around like a fish in water. If anyone needs a head the lover leaps up to offer his.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l0eT1FXvbQo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCjEUOdAMSqJlouunsr7WIdNhyLGg","youtubeID":"l0eT1FXvbQo","viewCount":6286,"eventDate":"2010-11-19","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"15"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"bhakti-the-eternal-key-for-wisdom-nithyananda-morning-satsang-08-nov-2010-message-l0et1fxvbqo"}}
