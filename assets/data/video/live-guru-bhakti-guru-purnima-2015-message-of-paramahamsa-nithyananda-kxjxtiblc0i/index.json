Nithyananda Vedic temples and centers in India, Nepal and worldwide, offered Naivedyam (divine food offering) to their beloved Guru and He showered his grace and blessings to all. Guru Purnima is such a rare day, when Guru accepts bhiksha and burns the karmas of the disciples.\nGuru Bhakti – authenticity in your relationship with the Guru – is his message for Guru Purnima 2015. To those who consider him as Guru, he declared that – “I want you to have the inner image of SHIVOHAM (Shiva I am).” Whoever does that, he as Sada Shiva, committed to give the boon of LIVING SHIVOHAM. If the inspiration and energy of the Guru enters into your inner image, life will no more be logical, it becomes magical. Guru Bhakti is an independent intelligence, the first step towards achieving anything including Enlightenment; the path, goal and result. Authenticating yourself authentically, aligning yourself to your Guru by aligning your inner image, outer image, others’ image, life image with your Guru’s connection is Guru Bhakti. \nAfter His message, Paramahamsa Nithyananda released the many offerings from different departments to enrich the world. Nithyananda University Press released many life solution books, also available freely online as e-books. The sacred text, Katha Upanishad was released, made the eastern vedic way with modern English translation on original palm leaf at Nithyananda Sacred Arts. As the Mahamandaleshwar of Mahanirvani Peetha, Paramahamsa Nithyananda released the official website for Kumbha Mela 2015 and many more.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kxjXtIBLc0I/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"kxjXtIBLc0I","viewCount":11671,"eventDate":"2015-08-01","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"7"},{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"live-guru-bhakti-guru-purnima-2015-message-of-paramahamsa-nithyananda-kxjxtiblc0i"}}
