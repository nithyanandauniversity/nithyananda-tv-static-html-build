But it was combined with a warning. \"Once more truth is\n\nexpressing, when ever people want to ask me, I sincerely want them to have but at the\n\ncorner of my mind there is a filtering system which just dilutes the sankalpa and lets\n\nonly the good happen. It straight away helps the person asking. I dont have sankalpa,\n\nso I send the person to the consciousness, and you get the right thing, getting wrong\n\nthing is the worst punishment.\"\n\nAnd as he warns, sometimes wealth is the wrong thing for you.\n\n\"To know about wealth, it's better to know from an enlightened being-creating\nsustenance, ability to handle when it's destroyed. Creation is all about intense\nenthusiasm, just radiate intense enthusiasm in any line you touch, maintain the high\nenthusiasm or at least 11 hrs a day, suddenly your attitude and attitude towards life\nwill take a quantum leap. High enthusiasm is wealth, anything you do, radiate high\nenthusiasm, that will become sacred. I can say if you have the high enthusiasm, you\nhave received a prasadam from Guru.\"\n\nPrasadam is not just food given, the real Prasadam is the high intense enthusiasm in\n\nanything you do. Filling your being is the right job of the master; more than fulfilling your\ndesires. Fulfilling our desires are too small, a real master fulfills your being.\"\n\n\"Creation is all about high enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is creativity. Whenever you are filled\nwith enthusiasm, those few moments you are experiencing God in your life. You receive\nthe sacred prasadam.\"\n\n\"High enthusiasm is real wealth. Extraordinary enthusiasm which forms the base for\ncreating wealth, that extraordinary reasonless enthusiasm is awakened only by inner\npractices, without this if you create wealth, it will not have enthusiasm to maintain your\nlife.\"\n\n\"Enthusiasm is an inner quality, it has to be awakened by awakening your Kundalini\nshakthi, when it's awakened, wealth is just a by product.\"\n\n\"There is a beautiful saying if Kundalini is awakened wealth presses your feet. Wealth\n\nshould be a servant to you. For wealth to be your servant, you need to be aware in your\nvery consciousness.\"\n\n\"eN Kriya is a direct process to awaken your Kundalini and high enthusiasm. Only when\nthe high enthusiasm is awakened, wealth gathers around you, you will have stability if it\nleaves you. The greatness of wealth is it can leave you. When it leaves you, it will teach\nyou more things.\"\n\nHe concluded by saying he will expand on more detailed techniques in the next session.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqk_XUbgAmk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBG9aOMamawjPZsjqrTYjDlYQbc-w","youtubeID":"qqk_XUbgAmk","viewCount":31841,"eventDate":"2011-03-09","duration":1947,"likeCount":377,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"35"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"wealth-management-through-en-kriya-nithyananda-qqkxubgamk"}}
