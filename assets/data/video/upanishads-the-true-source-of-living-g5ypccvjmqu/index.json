Paramahamsa Nithyananda initiates us into Vaada Prativaada – debating the spiritual truths. In the Vedic tradition, all human possibilities are used to internalize the spiritual truths. With deep analysis of ourselves, our being opens up. Debates are a powerful method to open up our being and internalize the Vedic truths. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n \nUPANISHADS!  I will continue to expand on the Shanthi Mantra.  So, let us start with the Shanthi Mantra.\n \nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते |\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||\n|| ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ||\n \nOm Poornamadhah Poornamidham Poornaath Poornam Udhachyathey |\nPoornasya Poornamaadhaaya Poornamevaavasishyathey ||\n|| Om Shanthi Shanthi Shanthih ||\n \n“Completion, this is Completion, that is Completion.  If this is removed from that, both remain, continue as Completion.  When the Completion merges into Completion, Completion alone remains.  If the Completion is removed or perceived to be removed from Completion, again Completion alone remains as Completion.”\n \nVivekananda says, ‘Forget about all you know as “religion”.  Go back to Upanishads, the Source.  Drink from the Source which will strengthen you.  Listen!  Drink from the Source which will strengthen you.’\n \nMany times, the “aachaara” – the every-day practices you observe – get the status of religion, and, sometimes, the “aachaara” starts even contradicting the main core truth of religion and you continue to practice the “aachaara”, leaving the religion!  It is like.....they say a story:\n \nIn one mutt (Matha - monastery), they had a cat.  The cat used to jump around the Sannidhanam (Head of the Matha) when he does puja.  He (the cat) will create a big ruckus. \n \nSo, the Sannidham has said, ‘Hey, first tie the cat before I start the puja, so that I don’t have disturbance.’\n \nThey tied the cat, and the Sannidhanam did the puja peacefully.\n \nOn the second day, again, they tied the cat, and he (the Sannidhanam) did the puja.\n \nThird day, again, they tied the cat, and he (the Sannidhanam) did the puja.\n \nAfter some time it became a habit that before the Sannidham starts the puja, you tie the cat, so that he (the Sannidhanam) starts the puja.\n \nOne day, the cat died, and they don’t know what to do: Without the cat, how to start the puja?  And they started searching around here and there for a cat.  ‘Hey, we have to tie the cat; only then the puja can start!’\n \nFinally, that day the Sannidhanam didn’t do the puja because the cat was not there!\n \nSee, the “aacharas”, unfortunately, get into the state of religion, when the reason, context, is lost in course of time.  There are thousands of stories where the “aachaara” becomes, “anushtaana” becomes religion. \n \nSee, “aachaara” and “anushtaana” is a way of living religion only if you know the context of the “aachaara” and the “anushtaana”.  Once in a while, you have to review yourself all the “aachaara” and “anushtaana” you are doing: Are you in the right context and doing it?  Based on this, you can measure.  The scale: Are you in the right context?  How to align yourself to the right context?  The scale to align you to the right context is Upanishads!  Again and again and again, go back to the Source, the Upanishads.  Upanishads will give you the clarity, setting the right context for the “aachaara” and “anushtaana” you are following, and making you live, making you live the context in your every-day life.\n \nSee, “aachaara” and “anushtana” means: “habits” and “lifestyle”; the every-day habits and lifestyle you are supposed to follow.  Neither you should give up the “aachaara” and “anushtaanas”, nor you should be without knowing the context.  You should do it knowing the context.  Doing it by knowing the context!  People who give up, lose spiritual strength.  And, people who don’t know the context, become superstitious.\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/upanishads-true-source-living","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/g5yPcCVjmQU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"g5yPcCVjmQU","viewCount":5888,"eventDate":"2015-01-25","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"upanishads-the-true-source-of-living-g5ypccvjmqu"}}
