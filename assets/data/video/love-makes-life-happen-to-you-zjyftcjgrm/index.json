When human beings bring integrity into their inner space they create permanent change. Those around them no longer see the former personality, and interactions become fresh and spontaneous. Healing follows as the old ways of relating are discarded and forgotten. Once integrity is infused into relationship, individuals discover that they are no longer limited to a narrow boundary of toleration: they can relate easily to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI will expand on how the integrity and authenticity expands your relationships and enriches you to have fulfillment.\n\nDhyan se suniye, first I wanted to make this three statements, one, relationship does not mean only the few human beings who live around you. When I use the word relationship I mean the relationship with your health, with your money, with your life, with the success, with the nature, everything.\n\nSecond, you also have a very inauthentic way of dreaming about your life - just to have a few cozy relationships around you and that is enough you are complete with your relationships and relationship dimension; which is completely wrong and inauthentic.\n\nThird, please listen, third only when you expand you to the level with integrity and authenticity anything, anybody comes in your breathing space, there is a conflict free complete relationship. You are going to experience fulfillment and success. Relationship is not related to the quantity it is related to the quality. Please listen, the third statement takes the concept of relationship completely to the different level altogether.\n\nLet us start from the beginning.\n\nSampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nPunahsuniye, Sampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nI will expand on these principles. When you bring integrity you will heal all the broken relationships, the conflicts which you create and created in the past; listen, creating in the present and created in the past, gets healed when you bring integrity. Let me repeat this 3 statements I made then you will understand one by one.\n\nPehle mein aapko teen cheezhe bathana chahtha hoon. Sambandh ka arth keval aapke aaspaas ke manushyon se sambandhith nahi hain. Jab mein sambandh shabd ka upayog kartha hoon, mera arth hain sabhi sambandhon se hain aap ka swasthya, paisa, jeevan, safaltha, prakruthi, sabhi.\n\nListen you need to understand the principle of relationship in larger context. Any conflict experienced in your inner space reminds you your inauthenticities in relationships. When you have the idea relationships are just nothing but what you experience with few people, you have very narrow, low, view and ideas. Listen aap apne jeevan mein in sabhi cheezon se sambandh rakhthe hain anya log, dhan vyapaar swasthya ithyadi; dhan vyaapaar swaasthya ithyaadi\n\nWhen you bring integrity you will heal all the damage you caused inside you, outside you due to the relationships, the ignorance you had in the zone of relationships. Listen your ignorance in the space of relationships not only causes damage in others, it causes damage in you also. When you cause damage in your spouse, in your mother, in your father, be very clear you cause damage in you; because your father, mother, spouse, all the relationships you carry decides the confidence and the energy you have about you.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZJYftcjGR_M/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ZJYftcjGR_M","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"5"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"love-makes-life-happen-to-you-zjyftcjgrm"}}
