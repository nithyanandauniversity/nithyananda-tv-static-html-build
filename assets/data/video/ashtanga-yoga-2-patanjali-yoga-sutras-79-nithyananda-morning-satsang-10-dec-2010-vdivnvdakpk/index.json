Yoga is the science of bliss.\" -- says Living Enlightened Master and Rare Avatar, Paramahamsa Nithyananda in today's morning satsang message on Patanjali Yoga Sutras, 79th Sutra, 2nd chapter and 28th verse -- \"Yoganganusthanat Asuddhiksaye Jnanadiptih Avivekakhyateh\". The sutra translation is \"By the practice of different limbs of yoga, the imputiries being destroyed knowledge becomes effulgent, up to discrimination\"\n\nDefining the clear difference between path and science, Nithyananda says, \"Path means some parts may not be able to travel. Science means equally reproducible on every possible mental & physical set up and which can be experienced by them\" \n\nIn this sutra, Patanjali emphasizes on practicing all the 8 limbs of yoga -- yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi. \n\nGiving deep insights from Patanjali's analysis, Nithyananda gave a warning to all the spiritual seekers and exposed exactly the space where human consciousness does not grow. \"The biggest problem for spiritual seekers is to go on accumulating knowledge because it gives so much excitement and NEVER PRACTICE IT! \n\nGiving an example of the Inner Awakening participants, He said that they all know that whatever they are hearing from Him during the 21 days program now is already on youtube in 8000 hours of His discourses in last 8 years.  But, whatever they try on their own doesn't work because as long as there is human bio-memory, it has to be trained, practiced and put in track by an experienced bio-memory. \n\nHe beautifully worded the commentary from the Bhagavatam, one the greatest devotional puranas glorifying the incarnations, avatars of Lord Vishnu, particularly Sri Krishna.  In Bhagavatam, Sukha Brahma, the Bhaagavatakaara, says to the sages (rishis) that when an incarnation happens on planet earth, thousands of auspiciousness happens around Him, but only one thing can go wrong and that is people become lazy and suffer when He leaves His body.  \nIncarnation is like a huge river flowing. But during the rainy season itself make a small canal and a tank inside your own land so that for some reason if the river dries up or you are not able to access the river you will have a water source.\n\nNithyananda says, \"That is why I insist on morning Sadhana -- creating an intense body and mind.  So, imbibe, fill yourself with that energy so you don't feel you have wasted time even if you are not around Me. Let you not be the person to experience that around Me.\"\n\n\nHis core message from this sutra -- Do Sadhana (practice) one session at 5am- bend and twist your body and prepare it for Kundalini Awakening. Then, sitting in His presence during Pratyaksha Paada Puja, do intense unclutching (with outer world and connect with inner world) and receive this intense bliss dose for the day. This should become a life for all our devotees and disciples. \n\nElaborating on \"Just unclutching\" - the Mahavakya (the greatest truth revealed by Nithyananda), He said Unclutching has only 2 parts -- Unclutch from unnecessary things and feel connected with higher truths. Upanishad is more powerful than zezen. For in zezen you sit unclutched, while in Upanishad you also melt. \n\nSo understand, Sadhana -- practice is the only way to avoid one of the greatest calamities, which can happen around the master, an incarnation, Avatar. Bring Sadhana into your being. Let Sadhana be your life style.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdiVNVDaKPk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCPWrfAul840nKfKgx8D4WUq8NZiw","youtubeID":"vdiVNVDaKPk","viewCount":7283,"eventDate":"2010-12-20","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"11"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"ashtanga-yoga-2-patanjali-yoga-sutras-79-nithyananda-morning-satsang-10-dec-2010-vdivnvdakpk"}}
