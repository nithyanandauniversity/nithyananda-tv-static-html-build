It is just with 11 people if you feel oneness then you are enlightened. Your Ananda Gandha, the original conscious space, goes on extending itself with everyone. But your anger, violence, the individual logic goes on shrinking you.\n\n\n\n\nTranscription\n\n'TURNING POINT SATSANG'\nMORNING SATSANGH BY PARAMAHAMSA NITHYANANDA -- WEDNESDAY, 3 APRIL 2014 -- NOTES\nNithyanandeshwara Samaarambhaam\nNithyanandeshwari Madhyamaam |\nAsmath Aachaarya Paryanthaam\nVandhey Guru Paramparaam ||\nI welcome all the devotees, disciples, samajis, satsanghis, Shrimahants, Mahants, Kotharis, Thanedars sitting with us all over the world through Nithyananda TV, ...\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\nToday I will expand on how the values of non-duality, Living Enlightenment, can become every day part of your life.\nPlease understand, the very structure of the original family system by Manu, the Cosmic Constitution writers....please understand, the great visionaries who wrote the Constitution of humanity..... \n\n \"Teamily\" means extension of you. It is just extension of you. You will feel the whole teamily is just more hands, more heart, more brain, more heads. All our Hindu gods portrayed with many heads, many hands, many legs, is nothing but they have that powerful teamily.\nI tell you, very sincerely I tell you, with the grace of Vishwanatha, in the presence of Kalabhairava, I tell you, I really feel I have some of my disciples, I literally feel that they are my extra hands, some of my disciples my extra legs, some of my disciples my extra brain! Means, I can literally share my work with them, or they vibrate in that very same frequency!\n\nSee, your Ananda Gandha, the original conscious space, goes on extending itself with everyone. But your anger, violence, the individual logic goes on shrinking you. The fight goes on between these two. Whenever you are in Ananda Gandha, you feel like expanding, you feel like sharing your life, love, understanding, enriching, everything. Whenever you are in an incomplete mood, powerless, you feel like shrinking. This fight is life! \n\nI tell you, your logic will not survive, your incompletions will not survive, your root-patterns cannot survive, your SDHD (self-doubt, hatred, denial) cannot survive the power of Advaithic experience, non-dualistic experience more than eleven lives.\n\n Please understand, just by listening to this satsangh don't think you are going to experience Advaitha. You have to DO it! This is your homework. By avoiding, by non-doing, by justifying, you cannot experience what I am saying. So, DO it! Pick up these eleven people in your life. One by one, one by one, start completing with them, making them understand they are co-creators of your reality and you commit with them that you will be co-creator for their reality. Not only commiting, but a few months of really living, really living, a few months of really causing, a few months of really making it happen. I tell you, you will just experience the non-dual consciousness!\n\n\nAnd I commit with you all, I wanted twenty-one people who are established in Advaitha as my Sachala Moorthy team, my \"teamily\". Understand, now I am opening the highest job offer on Planet Earth! You may be from the age of six to sixty, eight to eighty, whatever may be your background, rich or poor, married or unmarried, Grihastha or Swami, whatever, I am planning to have twenty-one members who are established in the space of Advaitha to travel with me and take care of my day-to-day routine, and all the classes, activities, programs, initiations; means, organizing; whatever we are offering to the world through me, organizing all that.\n\n Today whoever sends your and your teamily names to me with the Conscious Resolution, I commit with you all, I will be your co-creator to cause this reality.\nSo, now it is time. Pick up your paper, pen, notebook, and start listing out the names, and take your Tablet PC, and start sending the Facebook Conscious Resolution.\nI bless you all! With this, let you all radiate with Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility, Enriching and Causing eternal bliss, Nithyananda!
