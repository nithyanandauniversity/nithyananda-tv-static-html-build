The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 22, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) describes the ultimate state of enlightened lifestyle. When we are completely unclutched in our inner space, and still able to function smoothly in ordinary life, we embody the state of sahaja samadhi, which is the perpetual state of all enlightened masters. Once our kundalini is awakened, we achieve the highest level of consciousness and our spirit naturally flows toward this ultimate destination of sahaja samadhi.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Verse 22\n\nyam labdhvaa chaaparam laabham manyate naadhikam tataha |\n\nyasmin-sthito na duhkhena gurunaapi vicaalyate ||\n\n \n\nTranslation: Having obtained which one does not esteem any other acquisition as something more and being established in which one is not shaken by even the most grievous suffering.\n\nBhagawan is describing one of the greatest state of advaida experience. Please understand, there are various states, various stages of Samadhi -- Sabija, Nirbija, Savikalpa, Nirvikalpa, Bhava Samadhi. There are various stages of Samadhi. Bhagawan is describing the ultimate Sahaja Samadhi. If you can move your body and mind and relate with the ordinary world as they understand life but completely being established in your nirvikalpa Samadhi, it is called sahaja Samadhi.\n\nPlease understand, being established in the nirvikalpa Samadhi in your inner space, completely unclutched in the inner space, with that if you are able to move your body and mind in a so-called society's normalcy, that is sahaja samadhi. The most powerful, the ultimate spiritual state, even Gods need to do tapas to achieve this state. Even Gods who achieved their states by the various practices need to do unique special tapas to achieve this state.\n\nyam labdhvaa chaaparam laabham manyate naadhikam tataha |\n\nyasmin-sthito na duhkhena gurunaapi vicaalyate ||\n\nHaving obtained which state one does not esteem any other acquisition as something more and being established in which state one is not shaken by even the most grievous suffering is Sahaja Samadhi. We call it Sahaja Sthithi.\n\nThe state where the space where thoughts are not required for the smooth functioning of your body and even mind. Mind can function without thoughts. Please understand, even though usually the mind is bunch of thoughts it can function without thoughts. You may ask, \"How can mind  which is bunch of thoughts can function without thoughts.\" Just by the presence of the super consciousness, without any agitation or  the after effects and side effects which will be usually created by thoughts, mind can function, mind can flow. Unless the mind functions you wont even be able to stand, sit and walk. It  functions without any thoughts. No thought. No movement. That  is why I always tell people; I am not existing as you think of me. Same way, after I leave the body I am not going to be absent as you think of the absence. Understand, an enlightened master, a person who is established in sahaja samadhi, he will not be present as you understand presence, he will not be absent as you understand absence.\n\nKrishna says very beautifully, whoever understands the way I function, will be liberated. Understand he says, if you understand how I am functioning you will be liberated. How funny it is! You may think, \"Ah! How will I be liberated if I know how Krishna is functioning\". You will understand your mind is also functioning in the same way and just your ignorance creates complication. You will just unclutch that very moment. \"Wow! This is what! Then why was I connecting all the thoughts unnecessarily and creating constant suffering for me. I wasted my time creating constant suffering for myself.\" When you create constant suffering for you, even the good thing you want to do to others will become suffering for them and you will cry, \"Oh! Even if I do good things people take it bad.\" They are not taking it bad; you are doing it as bad even though you plan good. But when you stop torturing yourself, when you stop giving suffering to you, even if you do something what you think or you may feel as bad, will end up as good. When an enlightened master uses his trishool even then He only heals. When an ordinary man even if he gives gift he only destroys others.\n\nIn Calcutta, when I was staying, I saw, I was staying in the banks of the Ganges; two neighbours, every day morning there will be a fight. They will scream in that village Bengali. Scream means really scream.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5KTWPwKfaIY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDGELxohIKpERchdWIt-MvHlLwYzw","youtubeID":"5KTWPwKfaIY","viewCount":16420,"eventDate":"2012-09-24","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"the-secret-of-natural-enlightenment-5ktwpwkfaiy"}}
