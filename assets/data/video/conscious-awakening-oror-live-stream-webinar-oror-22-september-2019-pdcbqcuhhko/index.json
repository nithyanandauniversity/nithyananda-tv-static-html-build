In summary He reveals;\n\n\"You waking up to the truth you are consciousness is what I call conscious awakening. Second statement: decide to be responsible for everything happening outside you and inside you as your life, your reality. Third statement: because you feel you are responsible, do not try to engage with those complications, confusions, delusions. Don’t get tempted to engage them and correct them, alter them, repair them thinking that you made the mess you need to repair. No! No! Listen to the secret. That delusion is not trying to engage with you to come to peace. It is trying to engage with you, the moment you engaged with them, that delusion won the game. They are not expecting peace from you. They are expecting you engage with them. Once you engaged, you are gone. You are also deluded. That is why I am telling you again and again. Your internal complications or external complications - do not think by engaging you will solve. No! Neither create nor maintain or fight or destroy or engage - just absolute unclutching. And I tell you, this absolute unclutching … wakes up Paramashiva in you. You will have immediate conscious awakening.  I celebrate myself because I am consciousness. I want you to celebrate yourself because you are consciousness.\"\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
