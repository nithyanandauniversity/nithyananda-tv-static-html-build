Enemies are a danger. They only want to fight or deter us away from our goals in life, disconnecting us from reality. By practicing liberated thinking, we say \"no\" to enemies and thoughts that can poison our thinking. Liberated thinking is a powerful tool for living and enriching others.\n\n\"Do NOT Accept Enemy Requests!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\nI will expand, continue to expand on Sankhya.\n\nBefore introducing Sankhya, I will have to introduce the methodology, the way of thinking by human beings.\n\nPlease understand, thinking is one of the powerful weapons, tools you have, like legs for walking. Legs, and the ability to walk using the legs, is one of the capabilities you have. If you put your legs this way, you will go forward; if you put your legs this way, you will go backward. It is a system. To climb the hill you will have to use your legs in a certain way. There is a system. Just like legs have their own method, way, and hands have their own way, method, system,  \"thinking\" has a system, please understand.\n\nFrom the beginning, from the young age, we all have been taught how to use our hands, legs. We pick it up seeing people around us. But, unfortunately, thinking was never taught systematically, scientifically. Your thinking can be binding you, or your thinking can be liberating you. Your thinking can be binding you, or your thinking can be liberating you. I have seen sometimes, kids, they will put their legs and step in such a way that their own legs will lock and they will fall on the ground. Same way, there are people, their own thinking brings them down. For example, if you are thinking you will have food only if you snatch it from the other person, your thinking itself will bring you down. What will you do? Naturally, you will become a robber. If you think only by snatching it from the other person you will have food, you will snatch, then stealing, then robbing. Which is actually not required. It is your thinking that makes you whatever you are. It is your thinking that makes you whatever you are. Your thinking can be liberating you, or your thinking can be suffocating you.\n\nI see so many different types of people, so many different types of mental capabilities and disorders. I am telling you, mind is the most powerful instrument. The right methodology to think, right way of thinking is one of the most important, most important thing in human life. Just right thinking is enough to liberate you from all problems. Right thinking is enough to liberate you from all problems. Right thinking can give you the ultimate liberation. All the benefits of the ultimate liberation can be lived, radiated, expressed by right thinking. Sankhya system, the philosophy of Sankhya is science of Liberated Thinking. Kapila is the first being who radiated that science, developed that science, offered that science to the world in a very systematic way, in a very systematic way. Kapila offered that science, the science of Liberated Thinking to the world. See, when you have Liberated Thinking, you know who are you, you will become sure about you, you will become very certain about you, and you will become sure about who will be your friends, and you will become certain about who will be your enemies. When you become certain about who is your friend and who is your enemy, you will also be certain about what your friends want from you, and what your enemy wants from you, and you will also become clear what the world expects from you,\nEND OF SANTSANG:-\nDON'T ACCEPT \"ENEMY REQUEST\" is the essence of today's satsangh so that you don't need to look silly, you don't need to become silly.\n\nI will continue to introduce the science of Liberated Thinking, and then introduce Kapila, the Father of Liberated Thinking, and then introduce the whole system, how systematically you can think, be in high awareness, full consciousness. When you don't accept your enemy request....\n\nSee, the enemy send their enemy requests by constantly harassing you, abusing you, trying to harass you, or trying to abuse you. When you don't accept their enemy request, they are terrorized, understand? All enemy requests come from a very weak space, powerless space. Only a powerless guy will say - Aaargh! Do you know me? Do you know me? I will show you what I will do to you!\n\nA powerful man will always tell :- I will enrich you and show you how much I can enrich you.\n\nA powerless man will always say:- I will show you what I can do to you!, by trying to destroy you.\n\nClick for FULL Transcripts:- http://nithyananda.org/video/are-your-enemies-controlling-your-life","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6R-zSGOMI4U/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"6R-zSGOMI4U","viewCount":14642,"eventDate":"2014-09-19","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-your-enemies-controlling-your-life-6r-zsgomi4u"}}
