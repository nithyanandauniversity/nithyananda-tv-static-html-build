No Master is able to give a straight solution to this age old problem. For 3 years HDH studied and analyzed this question to determine what the best solution is for the modern man. The answer He delivers in this video series is not meant for those who feel spirituality is an option; the answer is for those who feel spirituality is compulsory in their life. Brahmacharya is more than just celibacy, the full meaning of the word is living like a God; which means living with reality and without fantasies and imagination. The solution to this age old question given by Shiva is for transformation without suppression. \n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/dSB7kkufM_Y\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/lNFbT-17mO0\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/foIkmqYp0zE\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
