Ganesha Chaturthi Special Satsang","slug":"kailasas-currency-launched-ganesha-chaturthi-special-satsang-d762rvrrz-o","description":"22 AUGUST 2020\n\n*FIRST LET US OFFER OUR WORSHIP TO GANAPATI. LET US DO GANESHA PUJA AND THEN ENTER INTO THE SATSANG.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM KAILASA:\n\n*BLESSINGS ON THIS AUSPICIOUS GANESHA CHATURTHI DAY! BLESSINGS TO THE WHOLE WORLD! BLESSINGS TO ALL OF YOU ON THIS AUSPICIOUS GANESHA CHATURTHI DAY! LET THE WHOLE WORLD, EVERYONE BE SHOWERED BY GANAPATI! PARAMASHIVA GANAPATI’S BLESSINGS AND ALL THE AUSPICIOUSNESS, ALL THE BEST THINGS FROM KAILASA!\n\n*I BOW DOWN TO PARAMASHIVA GANAPATI.\n\n*I BOW DOWN TO PARAMASHIVA.\n\n*WITH THE GRACE OF GANAPATI, PARAMASHIVA GANAPATI AND PARAMASHIVA, AND ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES OF KAILASA, I AM INTRODUCING THE CURRENCIES OF KAILASA AND RESERVE BANK OF KAILASA AND ECONOMIC POLICIES, STRATEGIES OF KAILASA, ON THIS AUSPICIOUS OCCASION.\n\n*SOURCE OF HINDUISM: SANSKRIT WAS THE RITUAL LANGUAGE TO CONNECT WITH GODS. TAMIL WAS THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN AMONG HUMAN BEINGS.\n\n*BOTH LANGUAGES EXISTED IN KUMARI KANDAM. IN A WAY BOTH HAD THEIR PURPOSES AND COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER. FROM THERE THE 56 NATIONS EVOLVED. I WANT PUT ON RECORD - I AM NOT SAYING THEY ARE HINDU COUNTRIES NOW. MANY HAVE BECOME ISLAMIC, SOME BUDDHIST, AND SOME HAVE BECOME SECULAR NOW. THERE WAS A TIME HINDUISM HAD 56 NATIONS.\n\n*I WANT TO PUT IT CLEARLY ON RECORD THAT KAILASA DOES NOT CLAIM ANY TERRITORY ON ANY OF THESE 56 COUNTRIES. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CLAIM ON ANY OF THESE NATIONS OR ANY BORDER, OR ANY TERRITORY.\n\n*I AM ONLY REVIVING THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF HINDUISM WHICH WAS PRACTISED AS A STATE RELIGION IN 56 NATIONS IN THOSE DAYS.\n\n*HINDUISM HAD THE GREAT NARRATIVE ABOUT COSMOS, ENLIGHTENMENT, SOCIAL STRUCTURE, ECONOMY, POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION, ABOUT EVERYTHING.\n\n*KAILASA IS MY HUMBLE EFFORT TO KEEP THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF HINDUISM ALIVE IN ONE REMOTE CORNER OF THE WORLD LIKE A SEED BANK, HOW IT KEEPS THE SEED ALIVE.\n\n*RESERVE BANK OF KAILASA - WE SIGNED A TREATY, MOU, WITH A NATION WHICH HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO HOST RESERVE BANK OF KAILASA. SO RESERVE BANK OF KAILASA EXISTS AS A LEGITIMATE BODY IN THAT COUNTRY THAT FUNCTIONS THERE.\n\n*I HAVE ONLY ONE SET COINS FOR RITUALISTIC RELEASE TODAY!\n\n*ON THIS AUSPICIOUS GANESHA CHATURTHI DAY I WANTED TO INTRODUCE TO ALL OF YOU. AFTER THE RITUAL AND PUJA, WITH THE BLESSINGS OF GANAPATI AND PARAMASHIVA, I WANTED TO RELEASE IT TO THE WHOLE WORLD!\n\n*VERY SOON IT WILL BECOME A FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM IN A COUNTRY WHICH HAS AGREED TO HOST THE RESERVE BANK OF KAILASA.\n\n*WE ARE SIGNING TREATIES WITH MANY DIPLOMATIC COUNTRIES. IN THOSE COUNTRIES IT MAY BECOME CURRENT. TODAY I AM DOING ONLY A RITUALISTIC RELEASE. SOON IT WILL BECOME FUNCTIONAL.\n\n*I AM NOT AGAINST ANY NATION OR ANY RELIGION. KAILASA IS OUR HUMBLE EFFORT AND OFFERING AT THE FEET OF PARAMASHIVA TO KEEP THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF HINDUISM ALIVE, TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HINDUISM IS A FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM NOT JUST FOR ENLIGHTENMENT, EVEN FOR ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES POLICIES, ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, SOCIAL STRUCTURES, EVERYTHING, IN EVERY LEVEL.\n\n*I AM NOT AGAINST INDIA OR ANY COUNTRY. I AM FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN SOCIETY DUE TO ONE MAIN REASON: MANY ANTI-INDIAN, MANY ANTI-HINDU FORCES, WHICH WANT TO ELIMINATE ALL THE INDEGENEOUS TRADITIONS OF INDIA. THEY WERE CONTINUOUSLY TRYING TO ASSASSINATE ME MULTIPLE NUMBER OF TIMES, IN MULTIPLE WAYS, TRYING TO PHYSICALLY KILL ME THROUGH MOB LYCHING, ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS.\n\n*WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE ALL THESE STATEMENTS: CONTINUOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, LAWFARE - USING LAW AS A WARFARE MECHANISM, CYBER BULLYING...IN MULTIPLE WAYS CONTINUOUS ASSASSINATION ATEMPTS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I HAD TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN SOCIETY.\n\n*OTHERWISE I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST INDIA AS A COUNTRY. I HAVE ALL MY LOVE, DEEP DEVOTION TO BHARAT MATA. ALL THE BEST THINGS I HAVE IN MY LIFE IS GIFT FROM HER.\n\n*I HAVE MADE A CLEAR WILL: WHATEVER IS DONATED TO ME, THE WEALTH ACCUMULATED AROUND ME - EVERYTHING WILL GO TO INDIA AFTER I LEAVE THE BODY, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSSED ON - TIRUVANNAMALAI, KANCHIPURAM AND MADURAI.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4256367217784429","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/D762RVRRZ-o/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"D762RVRRZ-o","viewCount":12359,"eventDate":"2020-08-23","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasas-currency-launched-ganesha-chaturthi-special-satsang-d762rvrrz-o"}}
