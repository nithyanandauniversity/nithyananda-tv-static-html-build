Mahadeva release us from all types of patterns with which we struggle and suffer the moment we remember, meditate on or create the space of Shivoham.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nToday is the day of ‘Shivoham’.  Most auspicious day for our Sangha; because, today is the day the ‘Big Bang’ started, the timeless Cosmic Mahadeva created the Time, assumed the form, blessed Brahma and Vishnu with enlightenment, Devi with enlightenment, and in his own half he made Devi as ‘Ardhaangini’. \n\nToday, I am also happy to formally inaugurate Nithyanandeshwara Temple in Karjat. I am inaugurating, doing ‘prana prathista’ to the temple in Karjat, Nithyanandeshwara Temple. My deity which is installed in Nithyanandeshwara Temple in Karjat will radiate Cosmic Mahadeva’s energy, and it will start materializing Vibhooti, Kumkum, Sandal, Honey, and it will bless whoever comes there for healing. Whoever comes and touches that murthy and bows down, they will all be healed from all physical, mental disorders; they will all experience Kundalini Shakthi.  And the deity will be LIVING deity, sitting there and giving blessings and boons.  I declare, that deity will be RADIATING KALPATARU ENERGY.  The Karjat Temple will become KALPATARU TEMPLE.  Blessings! \n\nAnd, Guadeloupe-Rameshwaram is offering twenty-one naivedhyams. Houston-Kalahasthi Sangha is offering sixteen naivedhyams. All over the world, many temples are offering naivedhyams and worship. With all my humbleness, love and devotion, I dedicate everything to Mahadeva, pray to him: let him accept and bless all of us and the whole universe on this auspicious day when Mahadeva gave that experience of Shivoham to Brahma, Vishnu, Devi.\n\nShivoham! This truth is not only a reality, it can be a powerful medicine, antidote for all the root-patterns you develop, parental conditionings you develop, societal conditionings you develop, and all the patterns with which you struggle, suffer. Understand, all the patterns with which you struggle and suffer, Mahadeva releases you. Mahadeva, listen, releases you from all the conditionings, the moment you remember, meditate, create the space of Shivoham. \n\nYou need to know, Mahadeva is not the totality of some dead qualities. It is like –\n\n·  If you have poverty, meditate on ‘Richness’; immediately poverty patterns will be broken.  No.  That is only a formula.\n\n· If you are weak, meditate on ‘Power’; immediately you will start receiving the power. It’s a technique. \n\n· If you are ignorant, meditate on ‘Knowledge’, and your knowledge will start opening up in you.  It is a methodology. \n\nMahadeva is not just totality of some good qualities. He is ALIVE.  When you invoke him, when you invite him, he just happens so powerfully, so beautifully, so alive, living.  He just makes all these parental conditioning, social conditioning, societal conditioning, root-patterns, engrams, he just makes them disappear, melts them away. \n\nWhen you invoke Mahadeva, Shivoham in you, don’t think it is a technique. It does the help of technique also.  If you do a technique what all help will happen to you, if you do a meditation technique what all the good things will happen to you, that also happens when you invoke Mahadeva in you.  But, that does not mean Mahadeva is the totality of these few dead qualities.  No.  He is a LIVING, VIBRANT, CONSCIOUSNESS!\nSee, if it is a technique, for example, if you have five layers of ignorance, if you meditate on Knowledge till the five layers melt down, you will experience the Knowledge.  If you feel weak for last ten years, if you meditate on Power at least next ten months, then slowly, slowly, the weakness will melt down; you will feel power.  That is a technique.  If you have a blockage in your Kundalini energy flow, and blow your nose, do the Pranayama and Kriya properly till that blockage is removed, Kundalini will be awakened.  That is a technique.  But, when you meditate Shivoham, it is not the strength of your meditation is going to decide the experience of Shivoham.  No!  He is conscious intelligence!  You invoke him, you request him: ‘Prabho, please be awakened in this body, in this mind, in this buddhi, in this intelligence.  Let you radiate whatever I know as me, ‘Aham’.  I am surrendering at your feet.  I am completing it at your feet.  Let you be.’\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/light-your-inner-space-shivoham#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/IeswZIjT--M/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"IeswZIjT--M","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"light-your-inner-space-with-shivoham-ieswzijt-m"}}
