In this clip taken from the discourses titled, \"The Power of no Judging & Detach Naturally\", Swamiji answers questions about enlightened beings.  He tells us that anything that comes out of an enlightened being is auspicious.  He expounds on this truth through a beautiful example from the Zen traditions.  Swamiji goes on to answer another question whether enlightened beings have pain & suffering.  During his answer he goes on to describe that for a living master the word, \"divine\" carries a strong meaning and experience, just as the word, \"I\" means to a non-enlightened being.
