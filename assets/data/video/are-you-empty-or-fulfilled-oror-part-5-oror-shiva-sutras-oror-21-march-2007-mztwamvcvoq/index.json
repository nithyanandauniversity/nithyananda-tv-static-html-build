The Shiva Sutras are verses which are direct techniques for enlightenment revealed by Paramashiva to Paramashakti. HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam reveals that when a person turns towards the source, miracles happen. HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam reveals that people should visualise empty boats in other people. Visualise these boats hitting your boat. The boats are empty, that is why others are shouting.  If the  other boats are fulfilled, there will not be shouting. HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam goes on to explain that all the 'How to' books and personality development books are the greatest conspiracy against Human beings, as they create more problems. By reading these books, the visualisation is changed and the energy flow is towards the other. HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam goes on to explain that even if it takes a long time, always choose solutions from an Enlightened Master. Master is #intense life. It is important to listen to Master otherwise a person will be taught by life through struggles and suffering.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
