This mantra is a direct spiritual practice revealed by the Enlightened Upanishad Rishis. By practicing and mastering this process, while one is alive, will naturally make him Enlightened at the time of leaving the body and live the “Eternal Life in the Cosmic Space”. None can do poetic wonders on truth like the Rishis, who repeat the syllables of remembrance – auṁ krato smara kṛtaṁ smara – once, as a prayer for reminding and praying to Cosmos (aum) about the goal of Oneness with It; and second, to remind themselves about the need for enlightenment or Oneness with Source. The first “aum krato is a prayer, second “krato” is Completion. The essence is – prayer and completion, both, leads you to enlightenment. Being an insider to Death, having experienced His death on the hallowed Marikarnika Ghat at Varanasi, Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals that, at that time, only the small desires or incompletions attack a seeker. Then, remembrance of the ultimate goal and the actions done by a seeker to experience Oneness are to be remembered and by remembering, one has to complete it, aum krato smara. \n\nvāyur-anilam amṛtam athedaṁ bhasmāntaṁ śarīram |\nauṁ krato smara kṛtaṁ smara krato smara kṛtaṁ smara || 17 ||\nTranslation: “Let the vital life-energy ‘Wind’ [vāyu] present in the body, now merge into the all-pervading, eternal cosmic life energy ‘Air’ [anilam]; and now let this gross body (along with subtle body) disintegrate into its basic elements and be reduced to the sacred ashes. O Supreme Consciousness known by the sacred syllable ‘auṁ’, remember—remember all that has been done to attain oneness with You. O mind, remember—remember the Supreme Consciousness, the Lord of all enriching sacrifices, whom you have been always remembering in your actions.”","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kFZB-ZhGiIU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"kFZB-ZhGiIU","viewCount":3267,"eventDate":"2016-01-30","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"eternal-life-process-isa-upanishad-mantra-17-kfzb-zhgiiu"}}
