Having the power to live in the state of completion and giving others the courage to live in completion too and thereby enriching them. Enriching is the first side-effect of nididhyassana.\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, in the Inner Awakening, we will be working on \"NIDHIDHYASANA\" -- \"Living\". I translate the word \"Nidhidhyasana\" with my own authority as \"RADIATING\".  Even though the word literally means \"Expressing\" or \"Living\", I am translating this word as \"Radiating\". It is a little more powerful!\n\nWhat I mean exactly by the word \"Nidhidhyasana\" -- \"Radiating\"?  Please understand, let your every decision every moment, every action every moment, every word every moment be aligned to what you authentically listened and to what you authentically internalized. Removing the gap between your internalized, intranalyzed great truths and your living. \n\nPlease understand, sometimes people ask me, 'Why are you so active, so workaholic, practically twenty hours a day working, Swami?'\n\nOnce for all I wanted to answer this question: 'I CANNOT BE IN ANY OTHER WAY!' \n\nIf you authentically listened, if you have done Shravana, listening authentically, Manana, intranalyzing authentically, you will be radiating authentically. Nothing can be done about it!  When the Shravana, listening, and Manana, intranalyzing, happens authentically, Nidhidhyasana, radiating will happen authentically. \n\nIntranalyzing and Radiating! Please listen, your life needs to be constantly powerful. You should be living to do what you want.  You should be talking to get the result of what you want.  You should be talking to move the other person the way you want. You should be talking into the listening of the listener! You should not be talking fighting with the patterns of the listener.  You should be talking into the listening of the listener! When will that happen? If you are established into your listening, you will talk into the other person's listening. \n\nIf I have to simply translate the word \"radiating\" in a very colloquial way, \"Nidhidhyasana\", \"radiating\" means: \"Minding your business\"! Not wasting your life! Laziness, boredom, diversion do not have a place in your life when you are radiating. \"Radiating\" means \"RADIATING\"!  It is straightforward! \"Radiating\" means \"RADIATING\"! Live your life intensely.  Live your life authentically. Live your life with strength. Live your life without confusion. \n\nFirst thing you need to learn to radiate, for Nidhidhyasana,\n\nThe first thing is: Learn to think and speak with the same cognition you arrive at by intranalyzing. \n\nPlease understand, I am explaining step-by-step:\n\nFirst, you authentically listen to the great truths. Whenever you authentically listen, whatever you listen will be converted as great truths by your inner-space. Your inner-space has the capability, it has the power to separate right and wrong. \n\nIn Vedic Tradition, we have a beautiful example called  Paramahamsa! The bird Hamsa (Swan), if you mix rice and some other items, it will separate the rice and only eat that. If you mix milk and water and keep that, it will suck only the milk and leave the water! The Hamsa, the bird Hamsa has that power. Same way, a man who takes the right things inside and leaves the unnecessary things outside is \"Paramahamsa\" (Supreme Swan). If you bring authentic listening into you, you will become Paramahamsa!  Anything you listen, you know what to internalize and what to reject, what to internalize and what to reject. \n\nAuthentic listening brings tremendous clarity. See, it is clarity which is really lacking in the seekers' life. Especially when somebody is interested to get enlightened, live the life of a Jeevan Muktha, clarity is a very predominantly important quality, a very predominantly important quality!  Please listen! Clarity!  Shankara has written a separate book on this subject -- \"Viveka Choodamani\".  The whole book is on \"Clarity\". Authentic listening leads to clarity.\nAnd intranalyzing, Manana, leads to cognitive shift. If you don't live that cognitive shift powerfully, you will lose it! Please understand! Powerfully living the cognitive shift is what I call \"Radiating\". \n\nI tell you, how to find out whether you are radiating or not?  Simply life around you will constantly be getting enriched, that is the signal! If the constant enriching is happening, then you are radiating!  Around me, whether you are six or sixty, eight or eighty, you cannot go without getting enriched! \"Radiating\" means, such powerful body language, such powerful words, such powerful thinking, you go on enriching, constantly winning the game of life!\n\nI tell you, Nidhidhyasana means \"having the power to live from the space of Completion and establishing everyone in the space of Completion\".","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uUR-vwbr6j0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDbk0I-_M7Kf-FyZm2Vr76iZJVhNg","youtubeID":"uUR-vwbr6j0","viewCount":3244,"eventDate":"2013-12-05","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"technique-for-powerfull-living-uur-vwbr6j0"}}
