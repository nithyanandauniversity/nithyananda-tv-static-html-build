Starting the sutras by giving the sutra meaning from the commentaries of Swami Vivekananda, Swami Prabhavananda and Swami Sachitananda, Living Enlightened Master and Rare Incarnation, Avatar - Paramahamsa Nithyananda takes us deeper into the 8 limbs of the Yoga as described by Patanjali, a great Siddha Purusha and the greatest incarnations on the planet.\n\nNobody except Patanjali is able to give such logical scientific step-by-step method to enlightenment. Infact, anybody after Patanjali is a follower of Patanjali. All the 8 limbs of yoga are not 8 steps but 8 parts that need to simultaneously happen in us.\n\nNithyananda declares that, \"I am not only giving you the technical knowledge of the Ashtanga Yoga- the 8 limbs of Yoga, but I am giving you the practical technology also, the technique.\"\n\nStarting with Yama, the basic thing in the spiritual practice is to align your actions with the understanding you have about life, about cosmos, about God, about world, about humanity. This is Yama.\n\nThen comes Niyama -- increase your understanding to the higher and higher level. Raise the level of your understanding of these basic truths through the right ideas. Sadhana and receiving the right knowledge these are the Niyama. \nAasana -- Preparing your bio-memory for the intense spiritual experience and breakthrough in your consciousness. When the deeper strands of DNA is awakened, non mechanical parts of the brain are awakened, your body should be capable of holding and radiating it.\nPranayama --  The technology of awakening and purifying your bio energy is Pranayama.\nThen Pratyahara -- Withdrawing your awareness from too many objects. It exactly means withdrawal.\nDharana -- Centering that awareness on one object. If your awareness is not centered on yourself, you will be continuously attacked by too many unnecessary fears. Dharana is responsible for fearlessness.\nDhyana means Pure Awareness -- the restful awareness.\nSamadhi means became consciousness. The awareness is settled in your bio memory.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUBGLlu_XSo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBLo0-fvMuYGg1PuSVxiRwvdwRS_Q","youtubeID":"VUBGLlu_XSo","viewCount":7114,"eventDate":"2010-12-24","duration":1170,"likeCount":47,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"16"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"ashtanga-yoga-3-patanjali-yoga-sutras-80-nithyananda-morning-satsang-11-dec-2010-vubglluxso"}}
