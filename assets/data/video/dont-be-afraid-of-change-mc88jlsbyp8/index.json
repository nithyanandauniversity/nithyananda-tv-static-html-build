Anything we want to retain in our lives, we just need to renounce the fear of losing it. Anything that creates powerlessness in our inner space will be taken away just to make us understand that we can live without that and we are powerful beings. \n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nLet us enter into Ishavasya Upanishad, the first verse, which I am expanding on last few days.\n\nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥\n\nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n\n“By the Consciousness all this is filled\nwhatever moving thing there is in the ever-moving world.”\n\nAs I was explaining last few days, Perception, Fact, Truth, Reality. Listen! Listen to these four words.\n\n· PERCEPTION: Within the limitations of Time and Space, your senses operating. Perception.\n\n· FACT: With a larger amount of Time and Space, your Perception coming to certain understanding is FACT.\n\n· TRUTH: Time and Space changing the way you perceive, and both of them come to Completion where your perception’s hindrance does not stop the reality being perceived because of the larger amount of Time and Space perceived. \n\nI know it is going above the head. Let me give you examples; then you will understand.\n\n·  The REALITY, the fourth word: Without the limitations of the perception and Time and Space, whatever is, is REALITY.\n\n I have given the example:\n\n· PERCEPTION is: Earth is flat, and Sun is going around the Earth.\n\n\n· FACT is: Earth is round, and Earth is going around the Sun.\n\n· TRUTH is: Earth is not exactly round; it more or less resembles Orange fruit.  And Sun is going around the Earth.\n\nPlease listen! I have explained that day, because the whole Solar System is not stagnant, even the whole Solar System is moving around centred on something else. Sun goes around the Earth in billions of years. Earth goes around the Sun every one year. Sun goes around the Earth in a few billion years. That is TRUTH.\n\nREALITY is: Earth has no defined shape.  And, Earth and Sun both go around each other, because, every billion year Sun goes around the Earth, every year Earth goes around the Sun.  The Reality cannot be half – just Earth going around the Sun, or Sun going around the Earth.  Both are going around each other is REALITY.\n\nWhen you restrict your Perception to limited time, you are caught either in Fact or in Truth.  Both are not ultimate.\nListen! Listen! I am moving to the next line of this Upanishad. Please understand this next line:\n\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Ma Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \n\nThe literal translation is:\n\n“With this renounced, you may enjoy.  Covet not the wealth of anyone at all.”\n\nLooks very simple moralistic instruction. But it is not! Please understand, if this instruction is moralistic instruction, I would not have even chosen to speak on Upanishads. I am not against morals, but order never comes by morals and discipline in the Cosmos. It is by intelligence and reality that order happens. Please understand, order of the Cosmos never happens by moral and discipline. Order of the Cosmos always happens by intelligence and knowledge, Truth, Reality.\nI have to set the context from which you need to look into this reality, this statement, understand. \n\n\nClick for FULL Transcripts:- video/dont-be-afraid-change#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Mc88JLSByp8/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Mc88JLSByp8","viewCount":14120,"eventDate":"2015-02-01","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"dont-be-afraid-of-change-mc88jlsbyp8"}}
