I can say it is one of the important revelation happened in me -- the highest utility of the body is to experience the pure witnessing consciousness in the body. That is the highest utility, highest possibility, best thing that can happen to the human body.\"\nHe expanded on this concept with three truths:\n1. The highest utility reason for the body is to radiate and be the center of the pure awareness.\n2. In front of the pure awareness all possibilities are dancing. When you go and live among the different civilizations only you will understand each civilization is a different world all together. So in front of pure awareness, all dances are going on. Whichever dance you pick up and whatever idea you will give more awareness you will assume that kind of awareness and tuning.\n3. The changing of the tuning does not happen only when you take new bodies. It happens even while you fall asleep and lie down in the night and daytime. Each time you fall asleep more than 4 hrs, 3 ½ ideas about yourself are removed and you have chance to put new ones or get the same old 3 ½  ideas or even more dangerous  ones. So every day you either grow or go down! \n\nHuman life is a great possibility, a very great possibility, and Swamiji is telling us these are some of the very deep secrets. He will begin talking on states of consciousness in the siddha tradition and techniques and herbs used to infuse that state of consciousness into human beings. \nIn the vedic tradition there are four states of consciousness. In the siddha tradition they work on one more state called 'turiyateetha.' They are: \n\n1. Jagrath -- waking state\n\n2. Swapna -- dream state\n\n3. Sushupthi -- Deep sleep state\n\n4. Turiya -- in the deep sleep sometime you go to that depth where you touch the restful awareness; is like a satori.\n\n5. Turiyateeta -- means being established in that turiya state forever; is like a nithya samadhi, eternal Samadhi.\n\nHe asked us all to understand this much now - Jagrath or waking state is a state where you can understand, analyze, accept and you will have ability to shift yourself to all the 5 states and overlapping of all the 5 states on to each other.\nHe ended with this blessing, \"Let the grace of siddhas be with all of us to experience the highest state of consciousness through the understanding of different states.
