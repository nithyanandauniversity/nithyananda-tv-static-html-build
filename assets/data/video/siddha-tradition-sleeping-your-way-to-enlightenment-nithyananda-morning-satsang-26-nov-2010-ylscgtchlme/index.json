Today he explained the different states of sleep.\nYou don't have to waste much time on your waking world, concentrate on sleep and attain ENLIGHTENMENT. In the waking world you can create the outer world. After all, the outer world can't be achieved in sleep state so understanding sleep state leads to ENLIGHTENMENT. This will make your ENLIGHTENMENT quick, fast and easy!\nThe first level is sleepful waking - sushupti jakrat.  After you wake up from the sleep the state if you can explain the pleasure and qualities, experience of sleep to others, you were in the sleepful waking state. Sometimes early in the morning you feel you slept deeply and peacefully. This state is responsible for the rejuvenation of your body and rebuilding of your muscles. If you have this state physically everyday your muscles will be rejuvenated. This state will avoid ageing that day. So the more nights you spend in sleepful waking state, the more your organs will not age. \nIn the same way, he explained that NLP participants who had an intense experience of energy darshan the night before, will not experience aging in their organs for one full year. As an aside he explained what happened during the energy darshan the night before:\n\"And if you have been divya shariris, those around me helping, guiding, they are being trained to be divya shariris (divine extensions of his own body). It's like when the sun is shining if you keep ten mirrors toward sun, that whole area between the mirrors will shine not only because of sun but because of reflections. So these divya shariris reflect intense energy.\"\nNext state, Sushupti swapna -- sleepful dreaming state. After you wake up if you are not able to be clear about dreams, if you are doubtful, that state, that nature you are not able to tell very clearly the nature of sleep, that is sleepful dreaming. This is disturbed sleep, suffered by businessmen and stressed out people. It will age you. I call this hell.\nThe next state is sleepful sleeping: sushupta sushupte. The state in which the nature and pleasure of sleep is totally forgotten after waking. Sleepful sleep is okay. I can say it is neither wrong nor right, okay. This is what is actually induced by sleeping pill.\nSushupta turiya is the sleepful fourth state. After waking from sleep and realized atman is truth. Sometimes you wake up and know that for the whole night you were aware. But no tiredness, you know whole night you were awake. Not only will you not be aging, you will be anti-aging. Whereas sleepful dreaming will make you quickly age.\nHe will continue tomorrow with the final stages of consciousness and techniques for enhancing or avoiding the various states.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
