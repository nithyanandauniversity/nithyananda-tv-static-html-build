WE NEVER TRY TO SUPPRESS, OPPRESS, DAMPEN THE AUTHORITY OF THE KNOWLEDGE USING THE CONCEPT OF SACRED.\n\n*THE CONCEPT OF SACRED IS USED ONLY TO STRENGTHEN YOUR INTENSITY OF SEEKING, YOUR INTENTION TO GAIN MORE AND MORE KNOWLEDGE.\n\nATATO BRAHMA JIJNASAT\nLET US INQUIRE INTO THE ULTIMATE REALITY EXISTENCE\n\n*KNOWLEDGE IS SACRED. VIDYA IS DIVYA. WE NEVER USED THE PRINCIPLE CALLED SACRED TO SUPPRESS, OPPRESS, EXPLORATION OF KNOWLEDGE. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THE TRADITION. THAT IS WHY ARE SO OPEN TO UPGRADING, EVOLVING OURSELVES. IT IS A LIVING CIVILIZATION. IT WAS, IT IS, IT WILL BE.\n\nसा विद्या या विमुक्तये\nSĀ VIDYĀ YĀ VIMUKTAYE\n\n*THAT IS WHY VIDYA IS GIVEN THE FORM OF A WOMAN. IN HINDU TRADITION,THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE - HER DECISION, HER WILL PERSISTENCE - MAKES THE WHOLE FAMILY FLOW IN THE DIRECTION OF ENLIGHTENMENT.\n\n*I HAVE SEEN HOW PASSIVELY, SILENTLY, NON AGGRESSIVELY, WITH TREMENDOUS WILL PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE, MY OWN MOTHER LED THE WHOLE FAMILY TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF ENLIGHTENMENT JUST BECAUSE SHE IS FROM THAT HERITAGE.\n\n*I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN CONSCIOUSLY PLANNED. JUST BECAUSE SHE INHERITED THE HERITAGE, SHE KEPT IT ALIVE VERY PASSIVELY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN MY MOTHER SHOUTING OR FIGHTING OR SCREAMING WITH MY GRANDMOTHER, MEANS HER MOTHER-IN-LAW OR MY FATHER, HER HUSBAND - OR WITH ANYBODY IN THE FAMILY!\n\n*I WON'T SAY SHE DID NOT HAVE THE DIFFICULTIES OF A MIDDLE CLASS OR LOWER MIDDLE CLASS HINDU FAMILY IN AN INDIAN VILLAGE. SHE HAD ALL THE DIFFICULTIES. BUT SHE ALWAYS KEPT THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER, DROVE THE WHOLE THING IN THE DIRECTION OF JEEVAN MUKTI JUST BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT SHE LEARNT FROM THE ELDERS. THE ECOSYSTEM’S INSPIRATION...!\n\n*TILL YOU ARE 25, THE ECOSYSTEM WILL INSPIRE YOU. AFTER YOU CROSS 25, YOU SHOULD BECOME THE STRENGTH FOR THE ECOSYSTEM. THAT IS LIFE. YOU CAN'T GO ON EXPECTING THAT THE ECOSYSTEM SHOULD TREAT YOU CUTELY AND THAT IT SHOULD BE STRENGTH AND SUPPORT FOR YOU.\n\n*FIRST 25 YEARS, IT IS OKAY. BUT IN MODERN DAY, YOU ARE FAR MORE MENTALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, INFORMATIVELY MORE MATURE THAN A HINDU VILLAGE KID, SO YOU DON'T NEED 25 YEARS.\n\n*BY THE TIME YOU ARE 18 OR EVEN 16, YOU CLAIM SO MUCH OF FREEDOM, POWER AND AUTHORITY DUE TO THE SOCIETY STRUCTURE, BUT YOU DON'T TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY.\n\n*ALL HINDU KIDS: CLAIMING SO MUCH OF FREEDOM AND THROWING TANTRUM WITHOUT TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY, YOU ARE DESTROYING HINDUISM AND THE LIVING ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION.\n\n*BY 16 OR 18, ALL HINDU KIDS SHOULD START SUPPORTING THE ECOSYSTEM OF ENLIGHTENMENT. YOU CAN'T BE ANYMORE JUST SUCKING THE ECOSYSTEM, BE A LOAD ON IT, THROWING ALL YOUR TANTRUMS AND EXPECTING YOU TO BE TREATED VERY CUTELY. NO.\n\n*THE MOMENT YOU TURN 18, YOU SHOULD BECOME FEROCIOUS WITH YOURSELF AND LEARN TO BE THE SUPPORT FOR THE ECOSYSTEM.\n\n*DHARMO RAKSHATI RAKSHITAHA\nWHEN YOU SUPPORT / PROTECT DHARMA, DHARMA SUPPORTS / PROTECTS YOU.\n\n*THIS PRINCIPLE I AM TALKING NOW IS THE ECONOMIC POLICY, STRATEGY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HINDUISM.\n\n*THE HINDU CIVILIZATION IS FOCUSED ON JEEVAN MUKTI/ENLIGHTENMENT/MOKSHA. WHETHER IT FOLLOWS SHAIVA TRADITION OR GANAPATI TRADITION, OR SHAKTA OR SAURA OR KAUMAARA TRADITION OR GURU WORSHIP OR VAISHNAVA SAMPRADAYAS, OR ANY SAMPRADAYA, BASICALLY THE ECOSYSTEM, A CIVILIZATION, SAMSTHANA, IS FOCUSED ON ENLIGHTENMENT.\n\n*PEOPLE WHO KEEP THIS KNOWLEDGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT AND TEACH, ARE PAID, SPONSORED AT MULTILEVELS: PAID REGULARLY AND SPONSORED FOR SPECIFIC EVENTS AND SUPPORTED THROUGH GRANTS AND DONATIONS.\n\n*AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN THE SOCIAL INTEGRITY BY PROVIDING PROTECTION FROM THE EXTERNAL DESTRUCTIVE/INVADING FORCES OR INTERNALLY REVOLTING FORCES - THE KSHATRIYAS - ARE PAID AND GIVEN AWARDS AND REWARDS.\n\n*THE KNOWLEDGE KEEPERS WHO KEEP THE INTEGRITY AND EFFICACY OF THE KNOWLEDGE ARE THE BRAHMANAS.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4242296312524853\n\n*I AM GOING TO REVIVE THIS PRINCIPLE","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/D-aJ1J9JRQw/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"D-aJ1J9JRQw","viewCount":5104,"eventDate":"2020-08-19","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasa-economic-principles-their-alignment-with-enlightenment-science-d-aj1j9jrqw"}}
