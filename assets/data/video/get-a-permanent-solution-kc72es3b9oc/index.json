Completion with you makes the possibility for creating new, new diseases disappears. All the diseases you create newly is from the source of incompletion. Integrity stops you creating new, new diseases. Authenticity heals even the diseases you created earlier. When you start thinking with Integrity, with awareness, every word you give to you becomes commitment you give to you. It means, every desire you have is a commitment you have given to you. When you know every word you give to you is a commitment you make with yourself and you have to honor them, you will make only conscious commitments to you, conscious words to you. The conflicts in the life will drastically drop, the conflicts in the life will drastically drop. Success happens in life, fulfillment happens in life when the conflicts reduce. When the conflicts reduce, life energy starts oozing in you. Bringing Integrity with others is the only way relationships can be created, and it is not long-term process, long-term solution; it is immediate solution, permanent solution. We think always long-term solution means executing also is very difficult, which is not so. Here Integrity is a permanent solution and immediate solution which you can practice now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I will speak on how being in integrity expands your relationships with others.\n\nAaj mein aapko bataoonga ke kaise sampoorthi ki stithi aapke anya logon ke saath sambandhon ka visthaar kartha hai.\n\nIntegrity, yesterday I was expanding how the integrity directly creates relationship with you. Please listen, relationship is of different levels; One- able to sit with yourself and able to be in peace with you and completion with yourself.\n\nDhyan se suniye. You need to understand integrity. I will expand once more the definition.\n\nKrupaya punah suniye. Sampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purna kare aur swayam aur jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare.\n\nListen integrity profound most powerful immediate solution.\n\nKal main vivaaran kar raha tha kaise sampoorthi seedha aapke sambandh ko banaathi hai. \n\nFirst integrity makes you feel comfortable with you because the completion makes you feel comfortable with you. When you are complete with you, so many wonderful things can start happening. First, completion with you means the possibility for creating new, new disease disappears. All the disease you create newly is from source of incompletion.\n\nListen integrity stops you creating new, new disease. Authenticity heals even the disease you created earlier. When you start thinking with integrity, with awareness, every word you give it to you becomes commitment you give it to you.  It means every desire you have is a commitment you have given it to you.\n\n.....anekon sthar mein visthaar kartha hain ke aap apne sath purnatva ke saath sambandh rakh sakthe hai.\n\nSo listen, krupaya suniye, when you know every word you give it to you is a commitment you make with yourself and you have to honor them, you will make only conscious commitments to you, conscious words to you.\n\nIt's really unfortunate; you have so much knowledge and awareness about so many things happening in so many places around the world, it is so unfortunate you do not have knowledge about what is happening inside you. You are not aware of what is happening inside you. When you bring integrity in your thinking, first thing you will know what is happening inside you. Integrity makes you feel comfortable with you because the completion makes you feel comfortable with you. The words you give it to you if you have not honored they remain as a hangover in you and continues to burn you with incompletion.  If you don't honor the words you give it to you, you lose self confidence and self respect. If you don't honor the word you give it to others you will lose others confidence over you, their respect over you.\n\nListen everything in your life is totality of  honoring the words you give it to you and to others because the respect you carry for you and the respect others carry for you, the confidence others have for you and the confidence you have on you, these two put together is your life.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kc72ES3b9oc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"kc72ES3b9oc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"5"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"get-a-permanent-solution-kc72es3b9oc"}}
