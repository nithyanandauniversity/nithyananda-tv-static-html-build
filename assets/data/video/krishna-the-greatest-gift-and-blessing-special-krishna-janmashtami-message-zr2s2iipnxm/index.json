THE KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY CHARISMA HE MANIFESTED!\n\n*KNOWING KRISHNA, LOVING KRISHNA, BEING KRISHNA, CELEBRATING KRISHNA, IS THE GREATEST GIFT WE CAN RECEIVE FROM KRISHNA. IN ONE LINE - KRISHNA BHAKTI!\n\n*WHEN YOU ARE IN ROMANCE WITH KRISHNA, EVERYONE AROUND YOU FEELS YOU ARE KRISHNA.\n\n*KRISHNA BHAKTI INTERNALLY KEEPS YOU IN DVAITA BUT EXTERNALLY EVERYONE FEELS YOU'RE IN ADVAITA WITH KRISHNA.\n\n*SHIVA BHAKTI INTERNALLY KEEPS YOU IN ONENESS WITH SHIVA BUT EVERYONE OUTSIDE FEELS YOU ARE A GREAT SHIVA BHAKTA!\n\n*IF YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT THIS UNIVERSE, LIFE, GITA IS THE DICTIONARY. IF YOU WANT TO READ GITA, KRISHNA IS THE DICTIONARY.\n\n*IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE, GOAL, GOOD, BAD, READ BHAGAVAD GITA. THE MEANING GIVEN IN GITA IS THE REAL MEANING OF LIFE.\n\n*IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS VAIRAGYA, READ BHAGAVAD GITA. THE MEANING GIVEN IN BHAGAVAD GITA FOR VAIRAGYA IS THE MEANING OF VAIRAGYA.\n\n*IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS COSMOS, READ BHAGAVAD GITA. THE MEANING GIVEN IN BHAGAVAD GITA FOR COSMOS IS THE MEANING OF COSMOS.\n\n*FOR EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT LIFE - LOVE, DEVOTION, EVERYTHING, READ GITA. THAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE.\n\n*FOR EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT GITA, READ KRISHNA!\n\n*ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE ABSOLUTELY CHARISMATIC EXCELLENT PERSONALITY CALLED KRISHNA, ONLY WHEN YOU ARE IN ABSOLUTE IN LOVE WITH KRISHNA, AWED BY KRISHNA, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS BY KARMANYEVAADHI KAARASTE MAA PHALESHU KADAACHANA, OR .UTTAREDATMA ATAMAANAM AATMAANAM.\n\n*WHEN HE DECLARES ALL THESE GRAND STATEMENTS: “I TAUGHT THIS KNOWLEDGE TO SURYA. FROM SURYA IT CAME TO MANU. MILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE KRISHNA, SURYA EXISTED, BUT SO BEAUTIFULLY AND BOLDLY HE DECLARES THIS AND SHOWS HIS VISHVARUPA TO ARJUNA!\n\n*MAKING YOUR CLOSE FRIEND, WHO IS NOT JUST CLASSMATE, BUT GLASSMATE, WHO IS YOUR PARTNER IN CRIME, WITH WHOM YOU HAVE DONE MULTIPLE SECRET THINGS ABOUT WHICH NOBODY ELSE KNOW - MAKING HIM BELIEVE YOU ARE PARANDAMA, IS NOT A JOKE!\n\n*OF COURSE, HE IS REALLY PARANDAMA. THAT IS WHY HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE PARTNER IN THE CRIME REALIZE HE IS PARANDAMA!\n\n*LOVE, SACRIFICE, FEROCIOUSNESS, KNOWLEDGE, POWER, ALL THESE ARE SEPARATE WORDS IN LOWER MIDDLE CLASS LEVEL. IN THE PEAK OF PURE CONSCIOUSNESS, ALL THIS ARE ANANTA KALYANA GUNAS OF ONE BEING. THAT IS WHY I INSIST, UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT BEING. UNDERSTAND WHY KRISHNA IS CELIBATE, PURE BRAHMACHARI.\n\n*WHEN HE STARTED HIS RASA LEELA BEFORE THE AGE OF 10, HE IS EXTREME, PURE, ABSOLUTE EMBODIMENT OF COMPASSION.\n\n*HE IS THE MASTERMIND OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST WAR THAT EVER HAPPENED. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE MAHABHARATA WAR IS MUCH MORE THAN WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II PUT TOGETHER, IN NOT ONLY THE QUANTITY, BUT THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE.\n\n*WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II KILLED SO MANY STATESMEN. IN MAHABHARATA WAR, NOT ONLY SOLDIERS, SO MANY STATESMEN WERE KILLED. GIANTS LIKE BHEESHMA WHO CAN NEVER BE REPLACED WERE KILLED.\n\n*THE PERSON WHO HAS MASTERMINDED THIS GREAT DESTRUCTION, IS STILL CONSIDERED, WORSHIPED, REVERED, AND IN REALITY, HE IS EXTREME COMPASSION!\n\n*MEDITATE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS. UNDERSTANDING THE PERSONALITY OF KRISHNA GIVES YOU ABSOLUTE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT GITA. UNDERSTANDING GITA GIVES YOU ABSOLUTE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT EVERYTHING - ENLIGHTENMENT, UNIVERSAL RIGHT, WRONG, SEX, BIRTH, DEATH, PAIN, BLISS, LOVE, HATRED, BINARY LOGIC, INFINITE LOGIC - EVERYTHING!\n\n*ABSOLUTELY MIND BOGGLING REVELATIONS BY KRISHNA: URDHVA MOOLA MADASCHAAHAM, ASHWATHTHAM PRAAHU RAVYAYAM. HOW CAN THERE BE A BANYAN TREE WHOSE ROOTS ARE UP?!!\n\n*INTERNALIZE THE DEEPER REVELATIONS, SECRETS SHARED BY THE GREAT DEVOTEES WHO LIVED AROUND KRISHNA.\n\n*VYASA IS THE MOST AUTHENTIC BIOGRAPHER OF KRISHNA. SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED AROUND KRISHNA, HOW THEY HELD HIM - READ ALL OF THAT.\n\n*READING THE REMINISCENCES OF THE INTIMATE DISCIPLES IS THE WAY TO KNOW THE BEING OF THE MASTER.\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4214523005302184","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zR2s2iiPnxM/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"zR2s2iiPnxM","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"krishna-the-greatest-gift-and-blessing-special-krishna-janmashtami-message-zr2s2iipnxm"}}
