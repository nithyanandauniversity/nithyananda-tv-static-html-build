All we need to do is get out of the pattern that says, “am I qualified for these things”? We are qualified for everything that we currently have or want to have. Everything that happens is from pure consciousness, giving us the opportunity to either reinvent ourselves or allow Life to celebrate through us!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nWe will enter into the Upanishad mantra.\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् । \nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥\n \nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Maa Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nChanting is done just to retain the “paatta bhedha”.  Please understand, chanting is done basically to retain the “paatta bhedha” tradition.  Means, each guru, when they orally transmit these Upanishad mantras, they will have their own accent.  That accent differences are only called “paatta bhedha”.  To retain the “paatta bhedha” only, chanting is done.\n \nListen!  Today I will expand on the last part of this sutra:\n \nईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत् ।\nतेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम् ॥\n \nEeshaavaasyamidham Sarvam Yathkincha Jagathyaam Jagath |\nThena Thyakthena Bhunjeethaa Maa Gridhah Kasyasviddhanam ||\n \nWhatever is, which is changing and established in changing, is filled by Consciousness, Pure Consciousness.\n \nListen!  Whenever change is happening outside you, inside you, don’t feel life is sadistic, it is punishing you, it is taking away something which you really like or with which you settled down just now. \n \nAbility to understand that every change is a possibility for you to reinvent yourself, is “Renunciation”, understand?\n \n“Raaga” means: “Obsession”, “Attachment”.\n \n“Araaga” means: “Detachment”, “Dead”.\n \n“Viraaga” means: Understanding that the change is established in change, and that is filled with Consciousness.\n \nEvery change is done with tremendous compassion, and, consciously.  Please understand, no change is an accident.  Constantly looking at life as an accident is the attitude of atheists.  Understanding, whether the way it happens, or the way you perceive, is a “conscious happening”, is “Living Advaitha”.  The way it is happening outside, the way you perceive inside, both, if you think it is accident, you are “Atheist”.  If you understand it is “conscious happening”, you are “Living Advaitha”. \n \nWhether something happening outside, or something perceived inside, look in.  Look in, how many times you cursed life and what kind of idea you have about life and others.  If you think life and others are cruel, constantly exploiting, demanding, non-caring, non-supportive, whatever, whatever, then be very clear, you ARE “Atheist”.  You ARE “Atheist”!  Don’t think Atheism or Theism is dependent on whether you believe god exists in the form of deity or not.  Atheism or Theism is dependent on whether you understand god exists as everything or not!\n \nAs long as you cognize – “Why me?”, “Why me?”, “Why me?”, and that life is taking away the things which you really enjoy, life is sadistic – be very clear, all the happenings of your life you look at it as accident.  But, the change established in change – if I have to use a little better word: “change²”.....  Actually, why Upanishads are using the word “Jagathyaam Jagath” (जगत्यां जगत्) – “change established on change” – why you know?  Because, even your perception, “it is all changing”, will change!  Even your perception that things are changing, will change!  Even that is not complete perception.  If you ask me, ‘Then complete perception, there is no change, Swamiji?’ \nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/life-here-celebrate-through-you#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ione4t4KsG4/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ione4t4KsG4","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"life-is-here-to-celebrate-through-you-ione4t4ksg4"}}
