IF YOU PRACTICE SINCERELY IF YOU DON'T GET THE RESULT YOU CAN SUE THE RISHI. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHANDI IS GIVEN BY MARKENDEYA. IF YOU DON'T GET THE RESULT, YOU TELL MARKENDEYA. HE WILL APPEAR AND CORRECT ANY MISTAKES AND GUIDE YOU.\n\n*DURVASA IS A FEROCIOUS PERSON NOT AN ANGRY PERSON. HE HAS SUCH PURE SPACE. THERE IS NO REACTIONARY ASSUMPTIONS. HE IS SUCH PURE FEROCIOUSNESS. JUST LIKE HOW ANGER CAN APPEAR IMMEDIATELY AND GUIDE YOU. DHURSVASA'S CURSE, SCANDALS CREATED BY NARADA ALL THIS DOES GOOD TO INDIVIDUAL AND ALL THOSE ASSOCIATED TO IT. DHURSVASA DOES NOT DO ANY BAD.\n\n*I HAD THE FORTUNE OF LIVING NEAR THIRUCHY SWAMI AND KANCHI SWAMI AND\nI HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SMELL OR ODOR OF HUMAN BODY AROUND THIRUCHY MAHASWAMI AND KANCHI SWAMI, BOTH OF THEM ARE INCARNATIONS OF PARASHAKTI.\n\n*ONCE I ACTUALLY HAD A VERY INTIMATE EXPERIENCE WITH TIRUCHY SWAMI. WITH HIS GRACE AND BLESSINGS HE ALLOWED THAT KIND OF INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP .MY GRANDFATHER USED TO SERVE HIM. AND HE USED TO TAKE ME ALONG WITH HIM.\n\n*I ASKED HIM ONCE, \"SWAMIJI HOW COME THERE IS NO SMELL ANYTHING OF HUMAN BODY?\".HE EXPLAINED \"FOOD ONLY BECOMES BLOOD, BONE MARROW, SEMEN. IF THE FOOD IS PURE, THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SMELL. I HAVE SEEN ABSOLUTE DISCIPLINE IN HIS LIFE FOR THE QUALITY, QUANTITY, TIME OF THE FOOD. ON THAT TIME HE WILL COME, ONLY EAT THAT LIMITED QUANTITY, AND ALWAYS PURE ORGANIC SATTVIC FOOD. HE WILL FEED EVERYONE BUT HE HIMSELF WILL EAT ONLY HIS LIMITED QUANTITY.\n\n*HE IS EXTRAORDINARY EMBODIMENT OF THE LOVE OF THE MOTHER AND PROTECTION OF THE FATHER.I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO LEAVE TO START THE WORK I AM SUPPOSED TO DO . HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID YOU ARE MY SLAVE. I JUST FELL AT HIS FEET LITERALLY AND TOLD HIM LET THAT YOUR COMMAND BE THE ULTIMATE, YOU ACCEPTED ME AS YOUR SLAVE THAT ITSELF IS THE GREATEST.\n\n*ON ONE 19TH, I STILL REMEMBER THE DATE. I WENT TO HIS ROOM AND HE CALLED ME TO SIT NEXT TO HIM. SHIVAPURA SWAMI HAS COME TO MEET TRICHY SWAMI.SHIVAPURA SWAMI HAS HIS OWN ASHRAM.HE WENT OUT FROM TRICHY SWAMI ASHRAM TO START HIS OWN ASHRAM. THEY WILL HAVE CLOSE DOOR CONVERSATION BUT THAT DAY I WAS ALLOWED.THAT DAY PURPOSEFULLY, HE TOLD ME SIT. HE TOLD THAT DEVI TOLD HIM THAT UNDER A BANYAN TREE AN ASHRAM WILL HAPPEN FOR ME. HE ASKED SHIVAPURI SWAMI IF THE BANYAN TREE IN HIS ASHRAM IS THE SAME.\n\n*I PROMISE I DID NOT TELL HIM THE VISION I HAD OF THE BANYAN TREE BUT BY THEN I HAD SEEN THE BANYAN TREE IN MY VISION AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND THAT TIME WILL KNOW BY THEN WE WERE SEARCHING ALL OVER BANGALORE FOR THE BANYAN TREE.\n\n*FINALLY ONE DAY IT WAS ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES WHO HAD A BANYAN TREE IN HIS LAND AND TRICHY SWAMIGAL SENT HIM TO OMKAR HILLS WHERE I WAS STAYING.\n\n*TRICHY SWAMI CAME TO THE ASHRAM WHEN WE INAUGURATED PERSONALLY AND BLESSED.\n\n*THE ESSENCE OF THE STORY IS: TRY TO KEEP THE POWERFUL COGNITION YOU ARE ATMA, YOU ARE ATMATATTVA, WHILE YOU ARE EATING, WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING, YOUR BODY WILL NOT REACT LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BODY. THE HANGOVER OF SLEEP WILL NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLEEP ON YOU. FROM TODAY ,START LIVING THE CONSCIOUS PRINCIPLE ATMATATTVA.\n\n*YOUR CONSCIOUS PRINCIPLE IS NOT ONLY BEYOND THE FIVE ELEMENTS, WATER ELEMENT, FIRE ELEMENT, EARTH ELEMENT , AIR ELEMENT AND SPACE ELEMENT. THE ATMATATTVA EMPOWERS ALL THESE ELEMENTS. DO NOT ALLOW THE INTERFERENCES AND INFERENCES OF THIS FIVE ELEMENTS ON YOUR ATMA TATTVA.\nIF YOU JUST AWAKEN YOUR ATMA TATTVA, IMMEDIATELY PARABRAHMA,PARADHAMA, PARASHAKTI, PARAMASHIVA ALL OF THEM WILL MANIFEST IN YOU.YOU JUST NEED TO SAY YES.\n\n*EVEN THE TRUST REGISTRATION TRICHY SWAMI GOT INVOLVED. THIRUCHY SWAMI DIRECTLY HE HIMSELF WILL SEND SOME OF HIS DISCIPLES TO GUIDE ME.THAT SIMHASANAM HE MADE.\n\n*IN EVERY LEVEL THE WAY HE TOOK CARE OF ME, THE WAY HE ORGANIZED EVERYTHING MORE THAN A GODFATHER, GURU.WHEN I WAS NEAR HIM EVEN PHYSICALLY I JUST KNOW THAT HE IS DEVI. I KNOW THAT HE IS BEYOND MALE. CANNOT BE JUST MALE. I JUST KNOW HE IS A DEVI, PARASHAKTI.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/iT6_L_IoCTA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"iT6_L_IoCTA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"how-to-start-living-the-conscious-principle-of-atmatattva-it6liocta"}}
