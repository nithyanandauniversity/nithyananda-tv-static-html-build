Hinduism integrates us with ourselves expressing that we are the Cosmos. We are not slaves, sinners, or followers but the favorite inheritors of the Cosmos! We can use authenticity to build our self-image, aligning to this truth. It is our responsibility to enrich the world with Hinduism by expressing the atmosphere of peace, love, celebration, bliss, and the ability to coexist with all religions.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.
