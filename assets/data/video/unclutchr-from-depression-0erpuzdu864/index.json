The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 23, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) counsels us never to abandon our sadhana, our spiritual practice. Without continuous unclutching from suffering in life, even our feeling connection with the master can be broken. We become attached to our negative thoughts and memories and our devotion can be lost. Never-ending sadhana is the sacred secret for our salvation.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita Chapter 6, verse 23\n\n23 September 2012\n\nSuccessfully hundreds of participants have completed Nirahara samyama level 2, 4th batch today. Understand, this instruction is only for ashramites and THE Samyama participants. All the ashramites and THE Samyama participants, please understand, eat when you feel like. Do not have a law, not to eat or to have regular diet pattern. No.. do not have both. Don't have the habit that I will eat in time regularly 2 meal or 3 meal a day. No.. same way, don't have a law, I will not eat at all. The real samyama happens when you don't even have the vow of samyama and feel like not eating at all and move with the flow.\n\nI tell you, I don't feel like eating at all. Only when I see the body becomes too hot and needs something I pour some juice. So you don't even need to restrict yourself only to juice. You can even eat solid food whenever you feel like. But make sure neither the visualization of the food or the smell of the food or your mind interferes in the samyama and ask you to eat. Only like casually, \"Alright! Ah, today some temple prasad has come. Come on, let me put it in my mouth.\"\n\nTry to learn to live like a God. Gods do not have vow not to eat. They just do not feel like. So live like a Gods on the planet earth. I think now, especially THE Samyama participants have been really trained. So, now from today all the ashramites who are doing Nirahara samyama and THE Samyama, all the THE samyama participants, all of you will end the vow, you will not have this vow anymore. Feel like, have it. Don't feel like, leave it. So the samyama out of freedom. Samyama out of joy not out of vow. I tell you, then body just jumps into a new kind of wellness. It jumps into a new kind of that feeling well. So today onwards you will do something called unique FREE Samyama. The Samyama without the vow. So, from today you will have samyama without vow.\n\nToday I have something unique from our Siddha products release, officially Dhyanapeetam's Kadukkai podi and Kadukkai tablets. It is a sarvaroha nivarani. I am very happy to release these two. This is the only thing which I take regularly. I think I don't need to introduce about kadukkai podi anymore. All of you know the power of it. It increases the oxygen flow in the blood 300% and we call it in Sanskrit Haritaki and the exact meaning of the word Haritaki means 'the drop of the nectar fell from Indra's cup and that drop is Haritaki'. I can say it is 100% true. It is nectar. It is nectar. I tell you guys this is the most powerful spiritual cleanser. I wanted to give you the title. Not just body cleanser. Because the oxygen level in the body increases 300%, it directly works on your non-mechanical parts of the brain. When the non-mechanical parts of the brain gets awakened, then all the spiritual truths are understood you will be able to grasp all the spiritual truths and live. So, not only that from now, in all akashik reading sessions, Kalabhairava dharshans, haritaki will be given as a prasadam. Haritaki is the Kalabhairava's prasada. Kalabhairava should be offered Haritaki and this should be shared as a prasadam of Kalabhairava among the devotees. And all our devotees, every month on Chitra nakshatram and Ashtami should do, Ashtami is the thithi for Kalabhairava and the thithi in which Swamiji was born. We should have Kalabhairava pooja, Kalabhairava's worship and should have Haritaki as prasadam, share with everybody.\n\nI am doing some more research, is there a food item, cooked adding Haritaki, if that is there we will make that as a compulsory in our Anna Mandir. Nothing. Nothing like Haritaki. That is the really nectar from Devaloka.\n\nLet's start today morning satsang.\n\nIn Bhagavad Gita, 6th chapter Dhyana Yoga, 23rd verse.\n\ntam vidyaad duhkha-samyoga viyogam yoga-samgnyitam |\n\nsa nishcayena yoktavyaha yogo nirvinna chetasaa ||\n\nThe translation : Understand that separation from being absorbed with suffering is termed as 'feeling connection'. And this has to be practised with conviction, with an insight that does not pull you down.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ErPUzDu864/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLD4TDor-5_Pv-Sd5_hXkRtpFL_JJQ","youtubeID":"0ErPUzDu864","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"unclutchr-from-depression-0erpuzdu864"}}
