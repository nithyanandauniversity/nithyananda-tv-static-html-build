The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In this morning's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 5, Verse 15, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) expounds on the nature of the essential Self. Our inner space neither disturbs those around it, nor is it disrupted by surrounding events. It experiences neither suffering nor joy. If we regard this statement from the perspective of our past encounters we are convinced it is false, for each of us believes that we remember incidents of pain or delight. The part of us that has these feelings of agony and pleasure, however, is not our true essence. It is only the reflection of our essence -- our intelligence or manas, that perceives these sensations. When we understand that our inner space is pure, beyond any emotion, we can begin to live completely, in conscious clarity.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\n Bhagavad Gita Chapter-5, Sanyasa Yoga, Verse-15\n \n \nNaadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu\nAjnaanena aavrutam jnaanam tena muhyanti jantavaha\n \nThe translation:\n \nThe inner space does not choose bad fortune or auspiciousness.  Man is bewildered by the consciousness that is covered by ignorance. \n \nNaadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu\nAjnaanena aavrutam jnaanam tena muhyanti jantavaha\n \nBagavan is reminding all of us to get back to that witnessing consciousness, which is our origin, the place, the space in which we are established, the space in which we are going to dissolve. \n \nNaadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu\nAjnaanena aavrutam jnaanam tena muhyanti jantavaha\n \nThe inner space does not choose bad, it does not choose good.  It neither feels bad, nor feels good.  When you are covered by ignorance, that is the moment you feel something is bad, something is good. So Understand, first thing you need to know - Only for enlightenment, this human body has worth. Human life is worthy only for enlightenment!  It is not worthy for anything else. And if you are working, thinking, functioning, keeping anything else as the priority, suffering is inevitable. \n \nNaadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu\n \nHow I feel when I hear this line, you know, Naadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu.\nIf you attend this \"Koun Banega Karorpati\" shows, this kind of some shows and that person declares \"you won one crore\", that word how you will feel, I can say the same ecstasy, I feel when I listen to these words - Naadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu.  Because, the moment you hear you got one crore, now you know so many of your dreams are going to be fulfilled, your future is going to be bright  or whatever way you want, you are going to live.   There is a huge freedom in your life for you to fly.  When I hear this word, I feel exactly the same.  God! Then my whole future is free.  I am this free being!  Of course, even if I don't hear that, I am going to feel, that is different, because of the experience.  Even if you have 10 crore, if they give you 1 more crore, naturally it is going to be. \n \nI tell you, even if you have enlightenment experience, when Bagavan says this words, it is so beautiful,  reassuring, reconfirming,  your experience. \n \nNaadatte Kasyacit Paapam na chaiva Sukrutam Vibhuhu\nAjnaanena aavrutam jnaanam tena muhyanti jantavaha\n \nYour inner space neither suffers nor enjoys. Only when the ignorance is covered, only when your consciousness is covered by ignorance, you get into that confusion.  You are bewildered.   You can't understand what is right, what is wrong. You do not know what it is.  Only then suffering starts. \n \nYesterday I was reported by some of our Ashramites. One Kannada channel has collected few top psychiatrists and psycho-analysts of the country and gave them lot of money and try to do a very abusive show on me.  Do you know the funny thing?  Finally, without even their knowledge, without even they knowing, they complimented me and went away.  Let me tell you the whole show. \n \nThis anchor fellow who is this channel person, is trying to put continuously poison and convincing those psycho-analysts and psychiatrists to give a negative statements about me. He is saying \"when you listen to his discourses, don't you see he has a split personality?\" And they also took my different pictures, me sitting with goggles and Kailash, me sitting here like a Yogi in saffron, some of my photographs with Shervani and they even ran a show on my dress.  Of course about that I will talk later-on.  And with all these evidences they are showing all different pictures of me and the you tube clips, some time like a child talking, some time like a god blessing, all that they mixed","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3J_m1BJop8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAccmqV6Gqy_uRnXa2g6xysl4Ti7g","youtubeID":"T3J_m1BJop8","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"you-are-beyond-joy-and-suffering-t3jm1bjop8"}}
