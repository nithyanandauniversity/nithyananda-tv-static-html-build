Yesterday he explained Jagrat-Swapna, which means awake physically but dreaming mentally. Today's subject Jagrat-shushupte, wakeful sleeping, a state of complete memory loss of information due to total lack of awareness and concentration. \nSwamiji predicted our response, 'oh it is an extraordinary disorder, it will never happens to us.' He was adamant, ' Whenever I ask if you did what I give you this instruction you say no you never gave. You are in that state.'\nIf you don't remember getting the instruction, you are in Jagrat-Swapna. If you say you never got the instruction at all, you are in Jagrat-shushupte, wakeful sleeping. \nThere is another danger humanity suffers, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It is like seepage happening in a huge dam. When a dam seeps there is a danger, same as when your sleeping state seeps into waking state. If seepage grows, increases beyond particular level then all maintenance people will be shaken and release water because seepage gives warning dam may break.\nIn the same way seepage of deep sleep state into waking state and dream state is a warning that any moment your mind can break. You need to release all unnecessary engrams and samskaras. You can't stay in this state, it is dangerous.\nThe technique for breaking this is to sleep for two hours midday, between noon and 2 pm. Do this for 21 days which is one cycle. During a 21 day cycle any habit can be broken and a new habit created.  Always get up around 5 am and do physical exercise. Don't sleep until noon, then rest.  \nThe next state is Jagrat-turiya:  wakeful fourth state, the closest word for turiya is meditation, but it's not quite exact, it's a deep state of thinking.  This is the state Swamiji says you should entertain, encourage, and entrain.  Avoid the middle two states of wakeful dreaming and wakeful sleeping, they will lead to ruin. Live in a state of Jagrat-Jagrat: wakeful wakefulness, and practice this fourth state of Jagrat-turiya.\nThe tremendous ability to think in one line in a concentrated way is wakeful fourth state. Not having this state is sin. He encouraged us all to practice this state every day, and dutifully avoid the others.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
