Then he went on to explain some of the basic very root principals and truths of Siddha tradition. The subject for today' satsang is \"Awaken to the higher states of consciousness\". \nHe presented a table and clear technical and knowledge of how the higher states of consciousness exist so that we could understand and raise ourselves to it.\nFirst the 5 states - WAKING     DREAMING   SLEEPING   AWARENESS   CONSCIOUSNESS -- These are the 5 states. (jagrath, swapna, sushupthi, turiya, turiyatheetha).  Earlier discourses explained each of these states and how they overlap.  Then he put a table up which clearly identified which states should be encouraged and which should be avoided. If you understand this one table, you can become enlightened now. Actually this table is like a threat : better get enlightened or else!\nModern day human beings have lost the ability to sit and be. In each age of time some demons were there and incarnations came to destroy them. In this age the demon is TV. That is why he believes he is here. \nJust because of the habit of sitting in front of that box which makes you more and more idiot by every hour, every minute every second you spend, you just forget that you need to be in a wakeful state. Constantly being bombarded with a high light beam, fantasy ideas, you become insensitive to the waking state. The cognition in your brain starts happening so randomly, chaotically and so much of unaware way even for the waking state you become insensitive, non responsive and this goes on, you go on.\nThis idiot box is main reason for you staying in waking dreaming state and the method of teaching practice in modern age -- one dull dead idiotic teacher standing and just talking and students are in different states - this should be avoided. In vedic gurukul system we had very different teaching. All teachings were alive, practice based. If master gives technique for 10 minutes immediately student starts practicing.\nSleeping dreaming is the worst state of consciousness which should be avoided completely. Again, waking sleeping, dreaming sleeping, sleeping sleeping all these are different unaware states. These 6 states marked in red in the table should be avoided. All the other 19 should be encouraged as much as possible. About this 19 we will study in the next session. \nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
