Develop the Right Cognition to Live a Truly Rich Life as You Want","slug":"be-your-own-boss-develop-the-right-cognition-to-live-a-truly-rich-life-as-you-want-djbsklll34u","description":"This discourse was delivered by Nithyananda on 1st April, 2017, as Day 1 of the intense two day transformational program called Be Your Own Boss, expands beautifully on how to live a rich life and manifest everything you want by changing your cognition about self and wealth. \n\nNeither your ideas about being your own boss are right, nor are they wrong. Whatever ideas about being your own boss aremake you joyful also empower you! If you choose to be your own boss because being a worker is too hard, it will lead to being a poor man's idea of a rich man. Feeling empowered matters! When you choose out of empowerment, you will make yourself a success. In this video, Nithyananda explains how: \n\nCognitions create your reality. Understanding what you want is the foundation, it's a basic necessity. Your cognitions are created by your understandings. If you don't have what you want in life now, look in and see: what do you want? If you don't have the clarity about what you want, you will not be able to manifest it.\n\nSwamiji explains that a poor man's idea about being a rich man is not the same as a rich man's life. Poor man will think a rich man lives only for owning possessions or taking time off, while a truly rich man lives for Experiences, with Responsibility. A poor man who becomes rich will always live in fear of losing the wealth, and greed for more. The same way, a man who is free will enjoy life much more deeply than the imagined life of a free man by a slave. Being your own boss means living the life of a rich man's idea about being a rich man; a leader's idea about being a leader.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/djbSKllL34U/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"djbSKllL34U","viewCount":44114,"eventDate":"2017-04-23","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"36"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"be-your-own-boss-develop-the-right-cognition-to-live-a-truly-rich-life-as-you-want-djbsklll34u"}}
