He explained that Living Advaitha is possible by living in perpetual completion. In Nithya Dhyan all the best methodologies are used to awaken the non-mechanical parts of the brain which put you into a state of restful awareness or being sure about you. When you are permanently sure about you this is perpetual completion or living Advaitha.\n\nThe Technique\nLife Bliss Meditation is the meditation process which creates perpetual Completion in your system.  I will give you a few minutes; please settle down and adjust yourself, make yourself comfortable.  Then I will lead you step by step.\n \nYes!  The first step, please understand, the first step of the process is \"CHAOTIC BREATHING\".  Means, awakening and raising the prana, life energy level in your body to its peak possibility.  It is a most dynamic aspect.  You can put your hand on the hip and start breathing as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible.  It is like hyperventilating; that's all; nothing else; hyperventilating you.  Use your whole body to breathe. \n \nThe first step is just seven minutes.  If you want, you can sit on your heels with knees and feet together in Vajrasan, or you can sit comfortably; but use your whole body and breathe!  Use your whole body and breathe!  I can demonstrate by myself.  See here (Swamiji demonstrates).  Use your whole body and breathe as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible, but as comfortably as possible.  Let your whole body become alive!  Let the hyperventilation happen in you.  Please be sincere as much as you can.  Do it as long as you are comfortable.  If you have high blood-pressure, do it mildly, comfortably.  Others do it sincerely, authentically.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n \nNow move to the next step: \"INTENSE HUMMING\".  Sit in the same way.  Either sit on your knees or sit comfortably.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole awareness be on the humming sound.  It is almost like if you put your mouth into an empty vessel and create a vibration how it will be, same way.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole body vibrate with that humming sound: MMMMmmmmmmmmmm.....!!!  Hum as sincerely as possible, as intensely as possible.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Do it as sincerely as possible, as loudly as possibly, as deeply as possible.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n\nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the Root Chakra (Muladhara) at the base of your spine.  \nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the spleen area (Swadishtana Chakra).\nSee yourself in your navel centre as a powerful light (Manipura Chakra).\nNow bring your awareness to the Heart Centre, centre of the heart (Anahata Chakra).  Visualize yourself as a powerful light.\nNow bring your awareness to the Throat Centre, Vishuddhi Chakra.\nNow bring your awareness to the Third Eye between both the eyes, Ajna Chakra.  See yourself as a powerful light on the Third Eye.\nBring your awareness to the Crown Centre, the top of your head, the Sahasrara Chakra.  See yourself as a light on the Crown Centre.\n \nWith my Integrity and Authenticity, I bless you all!  Let you all experience Kundalini awakening!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!\n \nNow just relax.  Sit in the space of \"UNCLUTCHED\".  Decide to yourself you will sit in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any incompletion that comes up, complete and drop them.  Be in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any doubt, fear, powerlessness comes up in you, unclutch.\n \n(After some minutes)\n \nI bless you all and initiate all of you.  Let your Kundalini Shakthi be intensely awakened!  Let your brain mirror the neuron activities of an incarnation, the peak possibility!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!\n \nI bless you all!  Let you all experience the Complete Completion with yourself and others!  Let you all be the space of perpetual Completion!  Let you all be the space of perpetual possibility!  Let you all be the space of perpetual living enlightenment!  Let you all be the space of perpetual living Advaitha!\n \nI request every one of you, please practice this Life Bliss Meditation every day.\n\nThis video provides links to the following video's:\nThird Eye Awakening by Nithyananda\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na24g0vqx0A\nAnanda Gandha Chakra Source of Super Conscious Healing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqX7zgAqLxs\nWhy Vegetarianism? - Nithyananda\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysr2PhnZi7w","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YnYOOUs1oF8/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"YnYOOUs1oF8","viewCount":154158,"eventDate":"2014-05-25","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"6"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"life-bliss-meditation-nithya-dhyaan-the-meditation-process-ynyoous1of8"}}
