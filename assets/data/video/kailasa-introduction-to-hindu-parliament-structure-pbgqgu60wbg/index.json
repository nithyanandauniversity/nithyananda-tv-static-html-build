THAT IS KRIYA.\n\n*YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY MANIFEST POWERS. THAT IS JNANA.\n\n*AND YOU WILL BE IN ABSOLUTE BLISSFUL LIFESTYLE. THAT IS CHARYA.\n\n*WORK ON YOUR BODY - THAT IS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.\n\n*I WILL GIVE YOU ONE SIMPLE EXAMPLE, AN INCIDENT IN MY OWN LIFE. MY GURUS WILL INSIST ON ME TAKING EVERYDAY NEEM JUICE. MY GURU YOGA YOGANANDA PURI DID NOT LET ME EAT FOR ALMOST 5-6 DAYS. WHENEVER HE SAID I SHOULD NOT EAT, MY MOTHER ALSO WILL NOT GIVE ME FOOD. THEY BOTH WERE SUCH A WONDERFUL NEXUS!\n\n*MY MOTHER IS SUCH A SWEET, COMPASSIONATE PERSON BUT SO DEDICATED TO MY ENLIGHTENMENT AND THE PROCESS MY GURUS WERE DOING FOR ME.\n\n*MY GURUS USED TO TELL THAT THEY ARE PREPARING MY BODY NOT ONLY TO BE A YOGI TO LIVE A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE, BUT EVEN AFTER I LEAVE THE BODY, IT WILL NOT GO THROUGH ANY OF THE DEAD BODIES’ NATURAL DECAY. IT WILL JUST BE A NATURALLY MUMMIFIED BODY.\n\n*I DID NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THAT AT THAT TIME.\n\n*HE USED TO TELL ME, “THAT IS WHY SO MUCH PREPARATION WE ARE DOING. NOT ONLY NO ONE CAN POISON YOU, EVEN IF THEY POISON, YOU WILL NOT DIE; YOU WILL ONLY DETOX AND THE BODY WILL AUTOMATICALLY CLEANSE BY ITS OWN STRENGTH AND YOU WILL LIVE HEALTHY FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT. YOUR BODY WILL ONLY BE IN JEEVA SAMADHI.”\n\n*SO HE WAS NOT LETTING ME EAT FOR ALMOST 6 DAYS AND HE WAS FEEDING ME WITH NEEM JUICE. WITHOUT FOOD, GIVING NEEM JUICE AND ASKING ME TO BRUSH MY TEETH WITH THE NEEM STICK! THE NEEM STICK WILL BE LIKE A TOOTHBRUSH AND I HAVE TO TOUCH THE HARITAKI POWDER WITH IT AND BRUSH.\n\n*THE EXTRAORDINARY HUMBLENESS AND INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR LOVE GAVE ME THE COMPLETE COURAGE AND SECURED FEELING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS THEY HAVE DONE TO ME.\n\n*HE WILL DO ALL THIS AND HE WILL ASK ME TO WALK WITHOUT WEARING CHAPPALS. OF COURSE, IN TIRUVANNAMALAI, I NEVER WEAR SLIPPERS. THAT WAS MY LIFESTYLE. EVEN IN COLLEGE I HAVE TO WEAR THE SHOES MANDATORILY FOR THE WORKSHOP. I WILL CARRY THE SHOES IN A CARRY BAG AND WEAR IT AFTER THE BUS CROSSES TIRUVANNAMALAI BORDER AND BEFORE IT ENTERS TIRUVANNAMALAI BORDER DURING RETURN, I WILL REMOVE IT! THAT IS MY RESPECT TO ARUNACHALA!\n\n*SO HE WILL MAKE ME WALK AND ONCE I COME BACK HE HIMSELF WILL KEEP MY FEET ON HIS LAP AND PRESS THEM.\n\n*THAT LOVE GAVE ME THE DEEP SECURITY THAT THEY WILL NOT PUT ME THROUGH ANY UNNECESSARY TORTURE. WHATEVER THEY MAKE ME DO IS ONLY THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF TAPAS. THAT GAVE ME TREMENDOUS COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER THEY WERE ASKING ME TO GO THROUGH.\n\n*6TH DAY, STILL NO SIGN OF FOOD! AGAIN NEEM JUICE. FINALLY, I VOMITED. NOTHING CAME OUT. JUST THAT NEEM JUICE HE HAD FED ME CAME OUT.\n\n*AFTER CHECKING THE COLOUR HE SAID, “RONA NEER SAMAANAM AAYIDICHU DA. IPPA NEE SAAPPUDALAAM”. THE ACID IN OUR BODY WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BALANCING THE HUNGER, WHICH CREATES THE FEELING OF HUNGER, OF SATISFACTION, WHICH IS NOT JUST A CHEMICAL, WHICH IS A LIVING ORGANISM WHICH CAN BE PROGRAMMED, WHICH HAS ITS OWN BIOMEMORY, WHICH DECIDES THE SIGNAL OF HUNGER, SIGNAL OF SATISFACTION, IS THE RONA NEER. THAT RONA NEER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HUNGER. HE SAID, THAT HAS BEEN NOW BALANCED AND PROGRAMMED.\n\nTILL NOW THAT PROGRAMMING THEY HAVE DONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY HEALTHY, HAPPY LIFE. AS I SAID, 42, I CAN SIT IN PADMASANA. NO SPARE PARTS REQUIRED - SPECTACLES OR TEETH. HAPPILY, HEALTHY 20 HOURS A DAY I CAN DO MY WORK. NO MEDICINES, NO HOSPITAL VISITS, NOTHING. IT IS THEIR GRACE. I AM 42 BUT I HAVE NOT GONE EVEN 42 TIMES TO A HOSPITAL.\n\n*MAYBE I WENT FOR INAUGURATION OR BLESSING BUT NOT FOR TREATMENT! I WENT FOR A SURGERY FOR MY FRACTURE, LIKE THAT A FEW TIMES.\n\n*BALANCING OF THE RONA NEER IS A VERY POWERFUL METHOD. I WILL GIVE YOU SIMPLE TIPS:\n\nKEEP YOUR BODY ALWAYS HUNGRY. NEVER DUMP FOOD AND FILL IT. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL SUBTLE HUNGER. CONSTANTLY THE JATARAGNI SHOULD BE ALIVE AND BURNING.\nRONA NEER BALANCING GIVES YOU TREMENDOUS WILL POWER.\n\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4262695653818252","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PbGQGU60wbg/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"PbGQGU60wbg","viewCount":3077,"eventDate":"2020-08-25","duration":2766,"likeCount":103,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasa-introduction-to-hindu-parliament-structure-pbgqgu60wbg"}}
