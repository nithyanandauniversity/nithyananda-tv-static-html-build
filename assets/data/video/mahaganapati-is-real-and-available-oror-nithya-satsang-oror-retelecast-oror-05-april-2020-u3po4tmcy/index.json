He is real. He is really, really, really REAL. He is sitting in Kailasa as a living entity.  He is formless also, but with form also as a living being intensely. How intensely you feel you are alive, much more intensely He’s alive! \nMahaGanapati is real. He is the ultimate existence. He is available to all of us. He is accepting all our prayers, love, devotion, respect and even the offerings, the Naivedyams we have offered.\nHe is available to us. Just connect with Him with Mantra\n\nॐ गं गणपतये नमः\noṃ gaṃ gaṇapataye namaḥ\n \nStraight you can connect with him. He will respond because He gave this mantra. He Himself has revealed this mantra. He himself is now revealing it to all of you. He Himself has revealed and given permission for Me to reveal it to all of you.
