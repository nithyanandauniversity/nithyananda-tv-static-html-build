Just the way people chew gum to keep the mouth away from bad smell, we must chew the Upanishadic truths and thought currents to keep us away from mental bad smells. This is the secret of looking beautiful and graceful – and here is the Spiritual Beauty technique. By the Pure Questioning expressed in this first mantra, the more and more we cherish it, the more and more we contemplate on it, the more we will become joyful, radiating, strong and we will neither feel lonely nor need any external support. This is the SCIENCE OF LEADER MAKING. To be a leader needs us to have a certain courage to be with ALL-ONENESS. \nIn His extraordinary manner of defining the truths, Paramahamsa Nithyananda defines – “ALL-ONENESS when misunderstood become aloneness. If you approach the All-Oneness with powerlessness, it becomes aloneness. When you are powerful with All-Oneness, it becomes Shuddhādvaita (pure-all-oneness); when you are powerless in front of All-Oneness, it becomes aloneness.”\n\nWatch this truth-defining, leadership making and Spiritual beauty technique video and contemplate on the following verse. \n\nKena Upanishad (mantra 1)\nkeneṣitaṁ patati preṣitaṁ manaḥ kena prāṇaḥ prathamaḥ praiti yuktaḥ |\nkeneṣitāṁ vācamimāṁ vadanti cakṣuḥ śrotaṁ ka u devo yunakti || 1 ||\n\n[Pure Questioning:] By whom willed and caused , does the mind go towards and thinks its object? By whom directed and united with which, does the first vital life–energy, the chief cause [prathaṁ prāṇa] comes forth towards its activities? At whose will does this speech gets activated and speaks? Enlivened and directed by what luminous, divine power (by what invisible cause), indeed, do the eyes and the ears engage in their functions?”","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/MlE7iaR9V7k/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"MlE7iaR9V7k","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"have-eternal-romance-with-the-cosmos-spiritual-beauty-technique-mle7iar9v7k"}}
