After you prove yourself to be insane for 10 times , 11th time ,you give up and you think this is normal .\n\nComparison is one of the greatest tranquilisers human beings are using  to keep you in the same space of unconscious. \n\nThat we justify others insanity for us to remain insane , just because others are unconscious  we can also remain  unconscious. \n\nAny saint can  make you realise ,  but you have to realise - Finally the living has to be done by you ! No one can realise it for you - you have to live it , you have to realise it. \n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nPlease Listen, I am defining \"insanity\": For any action which you have done, any thought you have had, any space you have cherished and entertained, if you are not able to handle the side-effects and after-effects of that, you are insane! \n \nPlease listen! I am defining \"insanity\": Any action you have done, thought you have cherished, space you have entertained, if you are not able to handle the side-effects and after-effects of it, you are insane! \n \nLook into the life, look into the life, it is really, really, really unfortunate that every day you prove yourself to be insane! Please understand, one of the difficult things is, after you prove yourself to be insane ten times, eleventh time you give up on yourself and you think this is normal and you use others' insanity to justify your insanity! I tell you, comparison is such a great healer for you; that is why you entertain comparison. When it hurts, you try to get rid of it; but it is a great healer and tranquilizer you are using. Comparison is one of the greatest tranquilizers human-beings are using. It is one of the great tranquilizers -- that is the right word I will use -- to keep you remaining unconscious, to keep you in the same space of unconscious. To keep you ever in the space of unconsciousness, comparison helps. 'Oh, all human-beings are like this only! All are like this only!' No!  All are not like that! All are not like that! It is very unfortunate, it is really, really, really unfortunate, understand, that we justify others' insanity for us to remain insane. Just because others are unconscious, we come to the conclusion we can also be unconscious. No! No! Move your life from the pattern of unconscious and struggling. \n \nSee, any guru, any Master, any incarnation can give the science. They can make you even realize!  But YOU have to realize! Understand, YOU have to realize! Finally the living has to be done by YOU, not by any one else! No one else can realize it for you! YOU have to realize it! YOU have to live it! YOU have to radiate it!\n \nLast few days I am sitting and working on the complete syllabus up to doctorate on Samyamas on the whole Yoga system. There are major twelve streams of Yoga:\n \nThe Natha Yogis -- Gorakhnatha, Matseyendranatha -- the Navanatha Yogis, one sampradaya;\n \nSiddha Yoga Sampradaya; the South Indian great siddhas, Shaiva siddhas -- Agastyar, Pulipani, Bogar; those great siddhas, they have a unique stream of yogic tradition; and\n \nThe Yoga tradition by Nandi, Nandinatha Sampradaya, Thiru Kailasa Paramparai, Nandinatha Sampradaya; the great saint Tirumoolar, he brought it to the South; his tradition; and\n \nPatanjali, Patanjali's Yoga tradition;\n \nTotally major twelve streams of Yoga are available. I am making a PhD course syllabus, up to PhD.  It is like, first Diploma, then Degree, Post Graduation, then M. Phil., and Doctorate.  Collecting all the best of all these twelve traditions! It was never done before, because nobody, unfortunately nobody had access to all this knowledge, and access to the consciousness, enlightenment. There were a few who had enlightenment, but had access only to Siddha Sampradaya. There were a few who had enlightenment, but had access only to the Natha Sampradaya. There were a few enlightened who had only access to Patanjali's Yoga Sampradaya. Fortunately, by the grace of all the yogis, first time, enlightenment and all these twelve traditions are meeting and merging in one brain, in one body. I am sitting and capsuling all these as courses and programs, thanks to some of the great modern-day Masters, acharyas, translators, like Swami Satyananda Saraswathi, Laxman Joo, and Lonavla Yoga Institute, Shriram Sharma of All-World Gayatri Parivar, thanks to all of them and their amazing translations and interpretations.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9c9An847Alc/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"9c9An847Alc","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"you-dont-need-to-suffer-9c9an847alc"}}
