The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 5, Verse 17, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) discusses the experience of liberation from our attachments. The objects and habits we cling to serve a purpose for us; we find them useful in some way. Once we evolve beyond our need for them, our addiction to them drops away. The more of life we find useless, the greater our freedom. When we have no use for anything we can make all our choices without the bondage of desire.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita, 5th Chapter -- Sanyasa Yoga, 17th Verse\n \nTad-buddhayas --tad-aatmaanaha  tan-nishtahas-tat-paraayanaaha l\nGacchanthya-purnaavruttim jnaana-nirdhoota-kalmshaaha ll\n \nBeautiful verse!  I will do the live translation. \n \nTad-buddhayas --tad-aatmaanaha  tan-nishtahas-tat-paraayanaaha l\nGacchanthya-purnaavruttim jnaana-nirdhoota-kalmshaaha ll\n \nTad-buddhayas: Who are established in the intelligence! See, establishing yourself on intelligence!  One of the biggest problem human beings face -- They again and again tell you \"I understand what is right and what is wrong.  But I forget and do my own things\".  This is the one statement I hear from everybody every day.  \"I understand what is right, what is wrong.  But when it comes to action, I do my own things as per the old pattern\".\n \nWe need to understand, you are not born with the patterns with which you are working.  When you are not born with them, you can change them.  Please understand, when you are not born with certain pattern, it means it is created in you. Anything created can be changed.  Now you can destroy the old one and create the new pattern.  But constantly, for years and years and years, you go on cribbing \"No. I know what is right, what is wrong.  But I cannot do, I cannot look, I cannot see, I cannot change\".\n \nTad-buddhayas means established in buddhi. Means knowing clearly, anything I created I can destroy and recreate the new one. \nI have seen two types of people.  People who create the cribbing pattern \"Oh. I know what is right or wrong. But when I act, I act the way my patterns are\".\nThere is other group who thinks \"Let me try little, little\".\nThis group which cribs is in the level of cribbing even for next two years.  What two years, even for twenty years they will not be doing anything other than cribbing! \nBut this group which tries comes out of the old pattern, may be in 2 or 3 months, because every time you think \"I cannot, I cannot, I cannot\" you are giving strength to your ignorance.  Every time you think \"I can, I can, I can\" you are giving strength to your buddhi.  Every time you think \"It's Okay. What is the need for transformation, with so much of struggle?\" you give strength to your Tamas.\n \nGiving strength to your intelligence, Tad-buddhayas -- establishing yourself in intelligence means, every step trying to change you one inch; trying to transform you just one inch extra; inch by inch trying to transform you.\n \nTad-buddhayas --tad-aatmaanas  tan-nishtahas-tat-paraayanaaha: Establishing yourself in intelligence\ntad-aatmaanas : Second word: Establishing yourself in the truth that you are Atman, the soul, consciousness.  I tell you, the moment you remember you are consciousness, the moment you remember you are the atman, you are the pure soul, millions and millions of patterns becomes useless for you.\n \nI tell you, if you want to cross any pattern, it should become useless to you.  You will never be able to cross by fighting.  No! I tell you, you can never quit smoking by fighting with that pattern. You can never quit drinking by fighting with that pattern.  You may be drinking to escape from something. You may be smoking to prove yourself as something or somebody; may be smoking makes you feel good about you.  May be drinking makes you forget something about you.\n \nOnly when the utility disappears, addiction can disappear.  Without alcohol if you are able to divert yourself from your sufferings, just by meditation or some other activity, then alcohol may be useless in your life.  Only when it becomes useless, you will be able to come out of that pattern. \n \nSame way smoking, without smoking, if you are able to give the same feeling towards yourself that you are something which smoking gives, then smoking becomes useless to you.  Only when things become useless to you, you can walk out of those patterns.\n \nWhen you remember you are the atman, soul, there are millions of patterns in your life becomes useless, just useless!  You do not need them anymore. \n \nI should tell you from my experience.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fa23UE9W2tA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAEmL3UA2NeODtfc__-cKLMQHjU8g","youtubeID":"fa23UE9W2tA","viewCount":4871,"eventDate":"2012-08-28","duration":1409,"likeCount":126,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8186,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":244}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"do-you-feel-life-is-useless-fa23ue9w2ta"}}
