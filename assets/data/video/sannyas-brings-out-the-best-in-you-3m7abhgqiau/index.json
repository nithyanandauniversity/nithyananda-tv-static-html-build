The purpose for life is for completion! Only in the lifestyle of Sannyas can you both fully live the science of completion while enriching others by teaching them how they can also live in the space of completion. Sannyas can take us out of survival-need mode and social ignorance and is the best way to reach out to planet Earth, empowering people to live in completion!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI have a wonderful announcement.

You can expect a lot of wonderful spiritual programs.\n\nLet us expand on Sannyas.\n\nThe purpose of human life is you experiencing Completion and, please listen, you experiencing Completion and working, radiating, showering -- please understand, I am using three different words: \"working\", \"radiating\", \"showering\" -- others also with the same space of Completion.  This is the first and foremost goal of life. Completion, Completion, Completion!  Be established in the space of Completion. Go on helping everyone around you to reach the space of Completion.  Help yourself to be in the space of Completion.  Go on enriching everyone to be in the space of Completion.\n\nUnderstand, in no other lifestyle you can live in Completion, go on inspiring people to be in the space of Completion.  Sannyas brings out best of you.  See, a common middle-class man spends almost 90% of his life just food, shelter, clothes.  These three literally takes away 90% of his time because one-third of his life goes in sleeping.  In the remaining two-thirds, first twenty-five years goes to get education for food, clothing and shelter.  When you start making all that, you are already fifty, waiting for death.  So  large part of your life disappears  just trying to get food, shelter and clothes.  All I am trying to tell you is, by offering Sannyas I take away that basic problem from your life.  Now come on start moving to the next level.  It is enough. You are stuck in the same rut.  You eat what for?  To work. You work what for?  To eat -- over!  You don't come out of that rut of the basic survival need.  Let us raise the human-beings consciously to the next level.  Human-beings need to be told about the next possibility.  Human-beings need to be told about the next possibility, please listen. Possibility.  \n\nPlease listen, you need to know a very important truth:\n \nPeople, who change after the change happens, SURVIVE.\nPeople, who change along with the change, SUCCEED.\nPeople who lead the change are LEADERS!\n \nPeople, who change after the change, SURVIVE. People, who change along with the change, SUCCEED.  People, who cause the change, LEAD!\n \nI am telling you, I am the change for the world. Not as a pride, not as egoistic; I am telling you a simple truth. I am the change!  Change along with the change itself to succeed. Why do you want to change after the change to survive? Sannyas is the biggest change I am bringing to the world, making it as a mainstream lifestyle.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3M7AbhgqiaU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBJaGvPTSNAgSGpYEgHcqHEUETqpA","youtubeID":"3M7AbhgqiaU","viewCount":1994,"eventDate":"2013-11-21","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"24"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"sannyas-brings-out-the-best-in-you-3m7abhgqiau"}}
