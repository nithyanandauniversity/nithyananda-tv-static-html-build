As a boy, his guru told him: the physiological, psychological and neurological ups and downs you go through, are not you. The perceptions and experiences you have, are not you. The real intention you carry about what you want to become, that is you.\n\nYour intention is the only living mechanism in you. Other than your intention, everything else is matter in you. You cannot be controlled by the matter in you. Because my intention is living, but the psychological, physiological, neurological effects are non-living entities. The non-living cannot effect something which is living.\n\nRealising this truth does not have to take time. For Nithyananda it was an instant realisation, it was a gift froths Guru, and because of that he shares it as a gift also. During the night of Shivaratri, he gave this as a process and initiation for everyone:\n'Decide from now, declare it to yourself and others: I am just my intention to be. Other than my intention to be, no other experience (psychological, physiological, neurological) is me.'\n\nDeclare your intention to the world. If you keep it for yourself, you will forget. The moment you declare it courageously, you are responsible to uphold it, to live it. Others will remind you, that is the best way you can go on remembering. Nothing else is required other than simple remembrance: Smaranath Mukti - remembrance liberates.\n\nYou can never conquer depression, you can only make it irrelevant to you. You cannot conquer suffering, you can only make it irrelevant to you. You make it irrelevant by remembering this truth: the physiological, psychological, neurological ups and downs you go through, are not me. The perceptions and experiences I have, are not me. The real intention I carry about what I want to become, that is me. By remembrance, make all your ups and downs redundant, irrelevant to you.\n\nThis is the first initiation Nithyananda received from Arunagiri Yogishwara: You Are Your Intention. It is also the initiation he is now giving, in this Mahashivaratri night. Just remembrance of these truths is the process he suggests for all viewers, and especially for those looking to attend the Shuddh Advaitam process during upcoming Kumbh Mela in Ujjain.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Zp__OGyATEY/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Zp__OGyATEY","viewCount":33419,"eventDate":"2016-03-09","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"mahashivratri-2016-message-and-initiation-you-are-your-intention-zpogyatey"}}
