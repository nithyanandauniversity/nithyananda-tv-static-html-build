The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 9, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) reveals the layers of collective consciousness and how the world reflects them. Humans have potential to create three kinds of lifestyle, depending on their level of awareness. When society is dominated by the collective subconscious, it creates a money-chasing lifestyle ruled by greed. When collective unconscious has control over society, it evolves a lifestyle based on power and ruled by fear. Once we become aware of our greed and fear, and release them, we transform to a freedom-based system of independent thinking and individual responsibility.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita -- 6th chapter, DhyanaYoga, 9th verse\n\n \nSuhrun-mitraar-yudaaseena madhyastha-dveshya-bandhushu l\n\nSaadhush-vapi cha paapeshu samabuddhir-vishishyate ll\n\n \nThe Translation:\n\nThe one who feels the same towards an affectionate person, a friend and enemy, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful one, the unfriendly, the noble one or a sinner is said to be established in a superior state.\n\nUnderstand these few basic sacred secrets. Meditation is not an action. It is a lifestyle. That is why in the chapter on Meditation, Bhagvan is talking about all these things. You can never start meditating, you can only become meditative. Understand, there is a vast difference between starting meditation or becoming meditative. Meditation is not a Anacin, Metacin, Antidepressant. No! Meditation is not Anacin, Metacin, Antidepressant. Please understand, meditation cannot be just repairing something in you. It has to completely transform you.\n\nMeditating is different; being meditative is different. In this verse Bhagavan is very clear; your whole life should become meditative. The whole life should become meditative. Yesterday he was addressing objects, yesterday Bhagavan was saying, explaining in the last verse, how not to be disturbed by objects.\n\nNow Bhagavan is going to the next step, how not to be disturbed by the persons. Actually the seventh, eighth, ninth verses of Bhagavad Gita, these three verses can become a powerful samyama. First he has given us the technique to work with cold, heat, unpleasant, pleasant situations. Then he took us to the next level working with the fear-based mental setup and greed-based mental setup where you are free from the concept of greed. Now he is taking us to the next level, where he is making us free from the concept of higher, lower human beings. First he liberates us from atmosphere, weather, outer/inner. Outer is heat and cold. Inner is pleasant, unpleasant. Then he liberates us from the greed, objects.\n\nSama loshtashma kanchanah -- where you are free from cold; time and/or mud or a stone. He is making us free from the greed based patterns, greed. Now he is liberating us from human beings, sufferings that can be caused by human beings.\n\nHow when you drink more and more honey, only then you understand and enjoy it, same way only I am enjoying this Bhagavad Gita. Understand, through this verse, Bhagavan is liberating us from fear-based system. Yesterday itself I spoke on fear-based, greed-based, both the systems. But yesterday's verse, Bhagavan's Bhagavad Gita verse was talking only about the greed.  Sama loshtashma kanchanah. He was only talking about having impartiality between mud, stone or Gold.\n\nToday he talks about the power-based system, human beings, power-based systems. Please understand, power-based system is a product of human unconsciousness, greed-based system is a product of human sub-consciousness. Understand, power-based system is product of collective human un-consciousness; greed-based system is product of collective human sub-consciousness. You may ask 'what is the difference?' Unconscious means completely, the parts of which you are not unaware ( should be 'aware' ? ) but you try to make it aware, without awakening that unconscious into the super-conscious.\n\nEverybody has the feeling to become Lord of the Universe. You can become if you make your unconscious into conscious and super-conscious. When you make your unconscious into conscious, you will become Lord of you. When you raise that to super-conscious, you will be the Lord of whatever is in your space. More than the word Lord, I will use, you be in tune with the whole. This is the right way of becoming Lord of the Universe. But instead you try to become  a power center through political power. I tell you even in the school, the class leader is nothing but political power!","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBn8NHSC4jM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA_Jxdp71zP0e2d3LBL2zuuUJXN6w","youtubeID":"RBn8NHSC4jM","viewCount":2457,"eventDate":"2012-09-09","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"power-greed-and-freedom-rbn8nhsc4jm"}}
