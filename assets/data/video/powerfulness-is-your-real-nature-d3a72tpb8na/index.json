Whether you think people are lower or higher than you, comparing yourself to anyone is a form of powerlessness. Let us not fall in the sickness of comparison and complete with this pattern now!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and blessings.\n\nToday, the first day of Nithyanadeshwara Brahmotsava.  As you all may be aware, today morning, in Brahmamuhurta -- 5:30 to 6:30 -- the auspicious time, Dwajarohana has happened, flag-hoisting, invoking all the devatas, auspicious energies in this area.  So, now all of them are here attending the Brahmotsavam.\n\nToday is also the Skanda Sashti Brahmotsavam -- Soora Samhaara.  Subramanya is ready on his Suvarna Mayura Vaahana to destroy the demons.  Today evening, by 4 o'clock, there will be Soora Samhaara and Nithyanandeshwara is gracing us with Nithyanandeshwari in the form of Arunachaleshwara and Apeethakuchambika on the first day of Nithyanandeshwara Brahmotsava.\n\nToday:\n\n21st batch Inner Awakening, 8th day;\n18th batch eN-Genius, 8th day;\n21st batch Nirahara Samyama, Level-2, 5th day.\nToday's subject for Nithya Satsangh: \"Completion with yourself raises you to the level of Enlightenment and liberates you from the cognition of comparing yourself with others and keeping yourself in a very low level.\"\n\nPlease listen, one of the natural tendencies for you is comparing yourself with others.  And, whether you compare yourself with the people whom you think higher than you or whom you think lower than you, you are going to fall into the space of powerlessness.  Whether you think there are some people who are higher than you and you compare with them, or lower than you and compare with them, both ways you will fall into powerlessness.  \n\nIf you compare yourself with the people whom you think higher than you, you will fall into the powerless space of guilt, giving up on you, the idea you are not worthy enough; you will fall into all these powerless spaces. If you compare yourself with people whom you think who are lower than you, again you will fall into the superiority complex, arrogance, which is also a powerlessness.  \n\nPlease understand, at least in guilt you will be powerless and you will know you are powerless.  In arrogance and superiority complex, which usually comes to you if you have gone to Business School. No, I have seen in my experience, all the fellows, the business schools somehow destroy people.  Even among my sannyasis I have seen, fellows who have gone to Business Schools, so arrogant, abusive about everyone, about everything.  In arrogance, the biggest problem is you will be in powerless space, but you will not even know you are powerless; you will be thinking you are powerful. The fellows who are in guilt, the moment they hit the psychological problem, they will realize they are in the space of powerlessness. The fellows who are arrogant, only when they hit the physical problem, only when their health breaks down, they will understand they are in powerless space.  All these Business School fellows carrying arrogance, superiority, violence, they will never realize they live in powerlessness, they live in powerless space.  Their health will collapse; then they will start realizing. 'something is wrong. Why?'\n\nI tell you, whether you compare yourself with people whom you think are higher than you or you think are lower than you, you are in the space of powerlessness and you are destroying yourself.  And you are going to destroy yourself unless you raise yourself, unless you complete with yourself.  \n\nFirst let me explain to you the mental setup, the pattern, structure of people who compare themselves with others whom they think higher than them, guilt.  So please understand, now I will explain first the pattern, effects, side-effects of the people who carry powerlessness due to comparison with people who they think higher than them.  So, for example, if you are in the tenth rank, and somebody is in the first rank, second rank, and you are comparing yourself with them, what kind of powerlessness you experience, I'll explain now.  Listen.\n\nThe first thing will hit you is, the moment you compare yourself with the people higher than you, you will become powerless.  You will shiver, you will shake.  You will shiver; you will lose confidence over your powerful space.  You will think the powerfulness happened in you only as an accident but your nature is powerlessness.  You will come to the wrong conclusions about you which is the biggest curse. It is life imprisonment.  Please understand, life imprisonment, having the wrong idea about you and your life; is life imprisonment!  It is not just putting you in jail, putting you in prison.  I tell you, having the wrong idea, you carrying the wrong idea about you, wrong cognition about you,","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d3a72tPB8NA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBs9rs0c2SUCZ_xyRcdNK6ZJt0Q8w","youtubeID":"d3a72tPB8NA","viewCount":6832,"eventDate":"2013-11-11","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"powerfulness-is-your-real-nature-d3a72tpb8na"}}
