He began the series by invoking the presence of the siddhas. Over the last few days he has been explaining the states of consciousness according to the siddha tradition. There are four states: Jagrat, Swapna, Sushupti, Turiya and Turiyatita.  These all overlap creating even more variations on our states of consciousness.\nYesterday he explained Jagrat-Jagrat (Wakeful Waking). Today we entered into Jagrat-Swapna (JS). JS means, awake physically but dreaming mentally. He cautioned that this is one of the worst dangerous states for human beings. \nThe exact translation from the siddha tradition is:\nState in which some information is remembered and rest is forgotten due to wavering mind and lack of awareness.\nWhen an instruction is given and it is not done by you, exactly you are suffering with jagrat-swapna -- hyprocrisy . Either you don't trust the master who gave the instruction, or don't trust the instruction, or feel it somehow doesn't apply to you. But this is like drinking poison. You are sleep walking.\nSleep walking is the worst thing. Sleeping sleeping is ok, walking walking is ok. But in Sleep-walking, you don't know what you are doing. Sometimes you do irreparable things to yourselves. In JS, any karma committed, you have to suffer. Nobody can save you.\nIn waking waking, NO KARMA is committed. In waking sleeping, karmas are forgiven. But in waking dreaming no one can clear your karma, not even the master, unless you become enlightened.  Swamiji gave some examples using the ashramites and their behaviour. He reminded everyone watching that he was talking about them as well, not just the ashramites and devotees seated in front of him.\nIf you think you are doing everything for enlightenment but still suffering you are suffering with waking dream state -- wakeful dreaming-- JS. Swamiji gave this technique for the day:\nSit and analyze how you are suffering and struggling with hypocrisy. Contemplate on this one problem today. I don't want to give you too many words. Contemplate on this one problem intensely. JS -- wakeful dreaming. How you are struggling with it, suffering with it, almost all your problems are just because of this one state. Meaning whole day being in hypocrisy of justifying being in unawareness.\nContemplate on it and get out of it.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
