In this clip taken from discourse titled, \"Bhagavad Gita -- Chapter 3: Beauty of Purposelessness\", Swamiji explains the essense of Karma Yoga. To have freedom from reaction, moving away from work is not the solution, but the purification of the inner space is nececssary. Renouncing the furniture from the outer space will not help. Instead, we need to renounce the furniture from the inner space. A man who keeps his senses under his control, but not his inner space is a hypocrite. When we leave this body and enter into the next, the quality of life is judged based on quality of inner space, not based on quality of outer space.
