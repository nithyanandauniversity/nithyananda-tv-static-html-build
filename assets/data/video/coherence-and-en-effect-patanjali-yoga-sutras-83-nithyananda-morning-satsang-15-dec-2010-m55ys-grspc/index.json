The Rare Avatar, Nithyananda, declared the beginning of \"Satya Yuga\"- the golden age denoting the greatest conscious coherence on the planet and the universe. He named this effect as the eN effect - The Enlightening Nithyananda Effect. \n\nWhat is this eN effect? Paramahamsa Nithyananda explained, \"If you are initiated into unclutching, you are free from space. If you are initiated into unclutching from time itself, you are free from time. Wherever you sit, you raise coherence and you are experiencing eN Effect\".\n\n\"Niyamah, the coherence of Life\" is today's Yoga Sutra topic from 83rd sutra, chapter 2, verse 32, \"Sauca Santosa tapah svadhyaya isvarapranidhanani niyamah\". Explaining this sutra directly as Patanjali intends it; Nithyananda explained the essential difference of seekers, enlightened mystics, enlightened masters and an Incarnation, \"Niyamah means creating the highest possible coherence in your body. A man who can do this in his body is an enlightened man, who is trying to create this in his body is a seeker, who can create the same highest possible coherence in few people is enlightened mystic, who can create in large number of bodies with sadhana is an enlightened master. He who can create this in any number of bodies just by His presence is an Incarnation. The coherence is Niyamah.\"\n\nHe explained that all He is doing is creating this coherence in more and more bodies that can transmit this coherence to others. Anywhere you may be, if you are feeling connected, even if you are not in this physical space, wherever you many be and try to connect to me, the space does not limit you. You fall into the same coherence and experience the intense spiritual awakening.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda then revealed the secret process of 'unclutching' from the tip of the nose to catch time (kaala) as matter - the process that Inner Awakening participants are undergoing intensely. He added that, \"If you have mastered time, you will not have boredom in your life. The moment you break boredom, you can make time out of consciousness like thread out of cotton.\"\n\nThen, a great revelation came from Paramahamsa Nithyananda. He said \"Today, I can clearly saw the high frequency coherence. You don't know how much you are contributing to the world peace just by sitting and unclutching in the master's presence. We are the black holes of negativity and big bang of eN effect.\n\nI can see very clearly the eN effect happening beautifully around the world. When it has happened in one body it awakens kundalini and non-mechanical parts of that body. When few people sit together, the highest coherence falls in place and the N effect is created on the group. If a group sit in different parts of a city, eN effect is created in that city. And if different groups sit in different parts of the world, eN effect happens on planet earth itself. And, if groups at different planets sit in the same time and connecting, the N effect happens in the whole universe. It is time to create Satya Yuga.\n\nThe energy which I bought and the amazing positive conscious effect I am doing on planet earth is necessary. And the cosmos has decided to veto me, vote for me. So, it wants this greatest conscious effect on planet earth and in the universe. I have put the fire. Even I cannot withdraw it! It is not ordinary California fire that helicopters can put it off. NO. It is fire from the hill of fire -- Arunachala! The cosmic fire\"\n\nComing to the great 83rd Patanjali's sutra, Patanjali gives a very powerful technique to create highest possible coherence in you, in the community you are living, society you are living and ultimately the whole civilization you are living.\n\n\"Shoucha -- means pure internal and external space and can create the highest coherence in you.\nSantosha, happiness -- if you are carrying the blissful body language -- you are creating coherence in your community.\nTapah - If you have tapas, accepting all the suffering without questioning, suddenly you transform the whole community in which you are living. \nIf you have 'Svadhyaaya' -- you will put the whole civilization into the highest possible coherence. Ultimately, if you have 'Ishvara Pranidhanani -- I will put the whole universe into the highest possible coherence\"\n\nHe ended this breakthrough satsang by blessing all to make the whole universe into the highest possible coherence.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m55yS-grsPc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAi__2VFUxyzd5tmGmVzb7_TYob4A","youtubeID":"m55yS-grsPc","viewCount":9948,"eventDate":"2011-01-04","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"11"},{"id":"32"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"coherence-and-en-effect-patanjali-yoga-sutras-83-nithyananda-morning-satsang-15-dec-2010-m55ys-grspc"}}
