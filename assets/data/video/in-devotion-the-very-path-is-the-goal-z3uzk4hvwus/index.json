In this clip taken from Shiva Sutras discourse titled, Devotion  Path to Liberation, Swamiji says that philosophy can give knowledge because it can be used elsewhere.  But knowledge or experience of devotion can not be encashed.  It is fulfillment on to itself.  It cannot be a utility for anything.  Swamiji says that devotion is the closest subject to his heart.  Devotion is the technique that has librated more number of people than any other path or technique.  Devotion is the path that is blissful from the very first step.  In the path of devotion the very path is bliss, the very path is the goal.  Devotion is the ultimate experience, but not the final experience.  Swmaiji tells us that devotion is the ultimate experience happening all the time.  He then goes on to narrate a beautiful story of Gopikass devotion through a story from Bhagavatam.
