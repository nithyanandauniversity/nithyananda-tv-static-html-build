Bliss does not come from living Simplicity, but from living Integrity.","slug":"is-ignorance-bliss-bliss-does-not-come-from-living-simplicity-but-from-living-integrity-tu5pal3546e","description":"In this video clip, taken from the recent Ask the Avatar interview between T.V. Mohandas Pai and Paramahamsa Nithyananda, the question raised is whether ignorance is bliss. Nithyananda answers beautifully, \"Ignorance is bliss as long as it is not hit.\"\n\nHe gives the analogy of a compounder taking on the role of medical doctor: when someone gives pills specified to illnesses, he will think he is capable of doing the doctor's job, but can only be successful in this if the pharmaceutical corporations don't change the look of the pills! \n\n\"Ignorance is bliss as long as the context does not change. Ignorance is bliss if you don't change your city, if you don't change your street, if you don't change your life in any way. So, the so-called simplicity, cuteness associated with the simplicity, cannot be associated with the solution. The simplicity which comes with higher involvement is called Integrity. Integrity is the solution, not simplicity, because simplicity is more like the compounder becoming doctor. We should evolve higher than the mind; I call it Completion, where our depth radiates what we are independent and irrelevant to the mood swings we go through. Our core stands by what we are independent of the mood swings we go through. Up or down, good or bad, right or wrong, accepted or rejected, the core depth standing it's integrity and constantly ready to evolve only in the line of Integrity, not by ups and downs. If the ups and downs start guiding, the person is powerless. If Integrity only is guiding force, he is powerful.\"\n\nSee the whole interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpWPJj8QADI\n\nMake the most out of your Integrity, and start manifesting the purpose of your life: Be Your Own Boss! https://inner-awakening.leadpages.co/be-your-own-boss-manifesting-leadership-consciousness-v1rev1/","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tu5PAl3546E/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"tu5PAl3546E","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"2"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"is-ignorance-bliss-bliss-does-not-come-from-living-simplicity-but-from-living-integrity-tu5pal3546e"}}
