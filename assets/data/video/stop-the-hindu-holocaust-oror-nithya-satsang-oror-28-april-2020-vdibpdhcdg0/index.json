He shares people understand only one or two components of Hinduism as Hinduism. Like for example, some people understand only the lifestyle, charyapada. Like if you are non-violent and truthful, all the principle lifestyle of Hinduism: vegetarian, Yoga. Some people understand only that as Hinduism. There are some, not only think only lifestyle, charyapada as Hinduism, they feel everything else is not Hinduism. That is where the whole problem starts. Understand! They think the lifestyle of non-violence and truthfulness, the charyapada aspect, vegetarian food, yoga, just that much is enough. That’s all is Hinduism. We need to know Hinduism is a great spiritual science; Subtle, other-wordly but definitive science. \n\nWhen the anti-Guru Hindus don't understand the absolute, complete, definitive sciences of Hinduism, they think all these sciences are fake and they think these Gurus who manifest these sciences are anti-Hindus and they are really convinced that these Gurus need to be eliminated to keep the Hinduism alive. This is the most unfortunate thing. Actually I don't hate these anti-Guru Hindus. I only feel Oh! God, what a delusion and ignorance. See ignorance clubbed with arrogance and sometimes political power, media power, money power. These anti-Guru Hindus are more dangerous to Hinduism than the anti-Hindus themselves. Especially when they don't understand the principles, possibilities and definitive sciences of Hinduism; Especially these Kriyapada principles. I tell you, actually when you pour the mercury with the prana-pratishta mantras, it just becomes solid without any chemicals added. Just with the power of the mantra that alchemy happens. I have proved it multiple times. In a organic, natural way just by the power, the molecules of the mercury can be dismantled and assembled back as solid. From liquid level, it can be dismantled and assembled back as solid. The power of Superconscious. \nUnfortunately, because this was not demonstrated or reproduced in large scale last few hundred years, common Hindus have started thinking all these are fake. Anti-Hindus starting developing these narratives; all these are false, superstition, lies, cheating, charlatan, black magic, all those abusive words are thrown and the anti-Hindu narratives are developed by anti-Hindus. And the anti-Guru Hindus have started getting brainwashed by anti-Hindu. Hindus brainwashed by anti-Hindus become anti-Guru Hindus. Understand. Hindus brainwashed by anti-Hindus became anti-Guru Hindus. \n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
