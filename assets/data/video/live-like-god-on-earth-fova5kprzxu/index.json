Make this verse from the sacred Mahabharata part of your life and awaken your Powers - do not unto others that which would cause you pain if done to you.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.  I welcome all the Hindu Mahasabha Swamis sitting here in the satsangh, Swami Pranavananda and Shri Basava Swamiji, and Swamiji from Juna Akhada, and all the Hindu Mahasabha members, delegates of the State Committee, and disciples, devotees, samajis, satsanghis sitting with us all over the world at this moment through Nithyananda TV, Sadhna TV, Lotus News Channel, Janashree TV, Eshwar TV and two-way video-conferencing having Nayana Deeksha.\n\nI welcome all of you with my love and respects.\n\nAnd today, 20th batch of Nirahara Samyama, 3rd level, 8th day.\n\nToday, I will expand on the definition of Dharma and Power of Words -- Vaak Siddhi; Power of Thinking -- Mano Siddhi; Power of Feeling -- Prema Siddhi. Please understand, I am using a new word -- Prema Siddhi, because Love was never considered as a power in the logical, rational world. It was always considered as a quality. I tell you, Love is not just a quality, it is a power, because it can cause miracles, it can do miracles. And, ultimately Atma Shakti -- Power of Living. Vaak Shakthi, Mano Sakti, Prema Shakti, Atma Shakti. How we need to imbibe everything as part of us, we need to make everything available for us, above all, we need to know how simply to achieve this in our life.  \n\nPlease understand, to achieve the Vaak Shakthi, Vaak Siddhi, you don't need to escape into some remote forest, or do some unknown technique, method.  No, just in your life if you don't lie to your boss and wife, that's enough. If you can be integrated to your neighbours and to yourself, that's enough. 'Oh, that is the most difficult thing, Swamiji!' I know, people are actually ready to escape into Himalayas, because they have made their whole life a mess, they really wanted to escape, but they are not interested in cleaning up that mess they have created. I tell you, even if you escape to the Himalayas for the reason you made your whole present life mess, you can't be there and you have to disappear into some safe place, you are wrong. You are wrong and you are making the decision out of incompletion. I tell you, just simple Integrity and Authenticity, simple Integrity and Authenticity can bring all these great powers to you, can make all these great powers happen in you.\n\nI wanted to remind this story, how a single word or single letter missing, you will miss the whole essence of life.  \n\nPlease understand, you should also look, you need to really, really, really look, any decision, whether to escape into the Himalayas or get into the depths of life let it be out of Completion.  Understand I have thrown few ideas in front of you now.  One, Dharma. I'll give you the definition of Dharma. Mahabharata very clearly says, \"Don't do unto others what will cause pain to you if done to you.\" This is the definition of Dharma. Second, I can give you that verse also.\nन तत्परस्य संदध्यात्प्रतिकूलं यदात्मनः। \nएष संक्षेपतो धर्मः कामादन्यः प्रवर्तते॥\n|| Na tat parasya saṁdadhyāt pratikūlaṁ yad ātmanaḥ \nEṣa saṁkṣepato dharmaḥ kāmād anyaḥ pravartate ||\n\nThis is the definition of Dharma. Mahabharat 5th Canto, 1517th Verse, 113th Chapter of Anushasana Parva, 8th Verse, defines about Dharma.\n\nन तत्परस्य संदध्यात्प्रतिकूलं यदात्मनः। \nएष संक्षेपतो धर्मः कामादन्यः प्रवर्तते॥\n|| Na tat parasya saṁdadhyāt pratikūlaṁ yad ātmanaḥ \nEṣa saṁkṣepato dharmaḥ kāmād anyaḥ pravartate ||\n \nThis is the definition of Dharma.    \n\nNext, when this definition is imbibed into our speaking, you achieve Power of Words, the Vaak Siddhi express through you. When this definition of Dharma is imbibed into your thinking, the Power of Thinking express through you. When this definition of Dharma is imbibed in your feeling, Responsibility, it expresses, it gives you the Power of Feeling. When you imbibe this one truth into your living, the Power of Living expresses through you.\n\nPlease understand, just this one truth becoming part of your words, thinking, feeling and living is essence of Dharma. When your thinking imbibes this one truth -- \"Do not do unto others that which would cause you pain if done to you\" -- actually that is Integrity.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fova5kpRZxU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCx4CyXvwhHabG0OpNGh1CsNmkfIg","youtubeID":"Fova5kpRZxU","viewCount":8259,"eventDate":"2013-10-20","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"live-like-god-on-earth-fova5kprzxu"}}
