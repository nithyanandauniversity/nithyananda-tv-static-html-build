It stems from the concept that your body is the shell of your consciousness which is consciously and wilfully developed and designed by your will. This truth forms the basis of Indian medicinal systems (Siddha and Ayurveda) and the whole Samundrika Lakshana.\nBy studying the physical set up, the revelation of the mental set up is revealed. This theory forms the basis of yoga. Yoga masters have done amazing research on how every thought works on your system. Altering the mind by altering the body's dimension is yoga. Altering the structure of the body by understanding the mind is Samundrika Lakshana. If you alter your body, major samskaras of your system can be uprooted. Your body is a shell consciously created by your will. With this understanding, constantly work on it. Don't leave blind spots unattended on your body.\n\n\"In the Vedic tradition, the body is not just a machine. It is an entity with independent intelligence. You sit and design the skin color, hair, length, everything you sit and design. Every morning for 21 minutes-5 minutes after you are awake and 16 minutes before you wake up, that time plays a major role in the designing of your body.\"\n\nNithyananda gave the audience the following task: \"The moment you wake up, jump out of your bed. Every day you design your body, you design how you should look, how you should feel. You need to study 4 people and compare with the formula about your own body and mental set up. This samyama will give understanding about their mental setup and understanding on your own body and mental set up.\"\n\nNithyananda himself studied this process under Paramahamsa Shivananda in order to better heal people. \"Understanding on one's suffering mental set up will help you get out of it. Understanding of a mental set up will make it an object and you won't attribute suffering to your inner space. \n\n\"Doing Samyama on this sutra will help you develop the purpose of your relationship. Learn to curtail relationships that bring you suffering. Place and energy connect, body and consciousness connect. So if you study this sutra, it will help immensely in your day to day life and your own understanding of your body and mind. You will know to alter your body structure and free your mental set up.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c6993SZE3Ws/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCwdijgc1ucbLrexg9rR2FLHi_A_Q","youtubeID":"c6993SZE3Ws","viewCount":11330,"eventDate":"2011-03-01","duration":3095,"likeCount":159,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"17"},{"id":"32"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"photographing-minds-patanjali-yoga-sutra-126-nithyananda-satsang-28-feb-2011-c6993sze3ws"}}
