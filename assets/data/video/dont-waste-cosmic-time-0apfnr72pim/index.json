The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 6, Paramahamsa Nithyananda continues yesterday's explanation of reincarnation. Each time we uproot an old mental pattern, we take a new birth. This is the death of the previous \"life\" -- the previous way of being. The process of \"dying the mind\" -- assisting it toward death -- should gain momentum as we repeat it, the same way most skills move more swiftly with practice. Ultimately we reach our natural state, which is to die every time we fall asleep, and awaken to a new life.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nIn Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter, Jnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga, 6th verse\n\nAjaha api sann-avyaya-atmaa bhootaanaam-ishvaraha-api san | prakritim svaam-adhishtaaya\n\nsambhavaami-attma-maayayaa||\n\nTranslation -- \"Though eternal with the character of immutability and though the Master of\n\nall life forms, taking control of my inherent source, with the peculiar power of illusion I\n\ncome into existence with form.\n\nLet me enter into today's verse --\n\n\"Though eternal with the character of immutability and though the Master of all life forms,\n\ntaking control of my inherent source, with the peculiar power of illusion I come into\n\nexistence with form.\n\nIt is so beautiful. The unique concept of Hinduism is explained in this truth. In this verse\n\nBhagavan describes the principle of incarnation. See yesterday Krishna described what is reincarnation.\n\nPlease understand, the principle of birth and death. As I said every time you start\n\nresponding in a new way to a problem or situation or crisis, you take new birth. you live many time in one body many minds, in one mind many bodies. Sometime you are stuck with one mental pattern. Without coming out of it you spend janmas after janmas after janmas -- lives after lives after lives. Same way, sometime within one body, you go through so many minds.\nI tell you best use of time is within one body, go through all types of minds. That is best use of time. Don't waste cosmic time. People ask me Swamiji how do I know I am growing spiritually? \n\nUnderstand once in a while when you look back you feel God! Six years before how I was, how I respond to every situation, how my mental patterns were, now see how I am! when you look back in your life, God! Six years before how I used to respond. Some people why six years, 3 years before how I used to respond, now how I am, some 1 year before. If the period within which you feel then I was different and now I am different if that period is coming down, then you are spiritually growing. That is the measure of your spiritual growth. For some period it is 5 years, for some people it may be one janma.\n\nHe is fanning me (Swamiji refers to Meenakshi the parrot sitting next to him) See the period of transformation is what I call one birth. Today sit and do this like a homework. When you look back what was the time you will honestly feel as your old personality's death and the new personality's expression. \n\nIf you look back -- is it 3 year or 4 year or 1 year or 8 months.\n\nLook back. See the transformation period. That is what I call as time of one birth of your mind. One life of your mind. If all your patterns you are responding in a new way, then the old mind is dead -- it is one life of your mind.\n\nActually one life of your mind when it reduces, your spiritual growth intensely increases. See average one life of your body you know 80 to 90 years. Your average one life of your mind now you should know by doing this exercise. By digging it out you should know. Is it 5 year, 4 year, 3 year.\nUnderstand I am giving you the principle. Look in properly. Not even one pattern you should be given the old response. See the old response date when you used to respond in the old unconscious way. Now all patterns you should be responding in new way. If you have not yet started\n\nresponding to all patterns, still your mind has not yet dead. Major 10 or 15 patterns only you\n\nuse everyday in your life. Please understand, you may be thinking no Swamiji I use 2000\n\npatterns per day, no. you are not that intelligent. If you are really demonic and criminal, you\n\ncan be having 15 patterns. So maximum 15 patterns only all of you use per day. If that 15\n\npatterns are transformed and you are responding to them in a new way. When I say mental\n\npattern I mean when your irritation, anger comes up that is one mental pattern, tiredness, lust\n\n-- that is mental patterns. Sometime people are so unconscious. When lust comes they respond\n\nwith anger. When lust comes if you respond with romance you are atleast in your natural\n\nstate, but if you respond in a anger way","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ApFNR72PiM/maxresdefault.jpg","youtubeID":"0ApFNR72PiM","viewCount":5545,"eventDate":"2012-05-28","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"dont-waste-cosmic-time-0apfnr72pim"}}
