Whenever our requests comes from non violent space, Swamiji always accepts and blesses. However, when we operate in the wrong space, inspirations can even be lost, right in front of the eyes of the Avatar. Swamiji expounds on His vision to have hundreds of Sannyasi of Nithyananda Order, sitting around Him, going into samadhi, with physical body remaining unrotten, to continue to bless future generations of seekers with the strong energy field of enlightenment. The first step in making this vision come true starts with a nirahara lifestyle. Even though nirahara lifestyle is not a compulsory requirement as a Nithyananda Sannyasi, Swamiji envisions having many niraharist sannyasis world wide, simply because we practice authenticity with food. Come and enjoy the pizza story and how pizza brought about nirahara lifestyle into Nithyananda snagha.\n\nThe Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Jagatguru Mahasannidhanam His Divine Holiness Nithyananda Paramashivam (HDH) is the reviver of #KAILASA - the ancient enlightened civilization and the great cosmic borderless Hindu nation.
