The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 5, Verse 19, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) explains the source of extraordinary powers. When we establish ourselves in the Supreme consciousness, in the state of living enlightenment, we can surpass the laws of nature. This is not actually miraculous, it is simply fact. If we embody the divine spirit, we acquire divine abilities. Our lives become a reflection of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita -- 5th Chapter -- Sanyasa Yoga -- 19th Verse\nJuly 25, 2012\n \nIhaiva tair -- jitaha SargoYeshaam saamye sthitam manaha I\nNirdosham hi samam brahmaTasmaad -- brahmani te sthitaaha II\n \nThe translation:\n \nHere, ihaiva, in this world itself, the nature is surpassed by them whose intelligence remains impartial for the Supreme Being that is flawless in the same in all. Therefore, they remain established in the supreme.\n \nOh God!  Krishna is too much. What he says you know:\n \nIf you are established in the enlightenment space, in the intelligence, even now all the rules and laws of the nature is changed. If you are established in the supreme consciousness, all the laws of the nature is surpassed. And I tell you, wherever you surpass the laws of the nature that is what others claim as miracle. But for you it is \"Happening\". \"The Happening\", which is \"The Happening\" for unconsciousness fellow is crime for society. Which is \"The Happening\" for the conscious fellow, it is being part of the nature, flow of the society, which is \"The Happening\" for the super-conscious person, is miracle for society. \n \nUnderstand, which is \"The Happening\" for an unconscious fellow is a crime for society. An unconscious fellow does not plan and do the murder. Just yesterday, see whenever I come to Tiruvannamalai, I have one habit. This local villagers, 4~5 fellows are there, who will give me report. What is going on, that village talk, who ran away with whom, who is sitting with whom, who is hanging around with whom, who is killed by whom, whose house is sold by whom, whose house is bought by whom. I don't have time to see the news, CNN, IBN or the International things, but I will have 2 ~ 3 of these villagers. One of my informer is Mr.Krishnamurthy. \"Swamiji, do you know few days before there was a murder in Tiruvannamalai?\"  I asked \"What happened, why, who?\" He gives me thoroughly who is the person who planned the conspiracy, who is the person who went and killed. I said \"You are giving so much information, are you connected to Police Department?\"  He says \"No Swamiji. Even Police Department does not know this much\". I asked him \"Why did they kill that guy?\" He said \"Swamiji, these fellows have done some other murder earlier. This person who got killed now is the eye-witness. If he goes to the court and gives eye-witness, they all will be convicted\". I said \"What an unconsciousness!\" See, to escape from one murder conviction, they killed other person. Now it is going to be double murder.  Two murders!  So the person who has done both  murders, is not conscious person. He is unconscious.  He does not even understand the ripple effect of the whole thing.  So, just \"The Happening\" for the unconscious person is crime for society. If you ask that guy who planned and did the murder \"why did you do it?\", he will only scratch his head and say \"Oh, I thought if this fellow is alive, he will come to the court and give eye-witness. That may lead to conviction\". Okay that is true. But now, \"what have you done?  You have done one more murder. So naturally it is going to be now conviction for double murders, two murders!\"\n \nAn unconscious person does not think through. So whatever is the flow of life for him, is crime for society. For a conscious person, whatever is flow of his life, like he wakes up, morning he goes to the job, works in his office, goes for lunch, comes back, again works in his office, comes back to sleep, whatever is his course of life, \"The Happening\", it is part of society,  the flow of society. If you ask him \"Why are you doing this?\" He says \"That is the way life is!\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/IhkzuoTiVD8/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"IhkzuoTiVD8","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"31"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"make-miracles-happen-in-your-life-ihkzuotivd8"}}
