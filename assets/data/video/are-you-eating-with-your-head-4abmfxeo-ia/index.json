The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 17, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) relates the four principles of enlightened lifestyle. The key to a godly life, free of pain, is to be diligent. Nithyananda defines diligence as an attitude of restraint and self-awareness. The four zones of diligence are eating, sleeping, judgment and relationship. We should eat only when physically hungry and sleep only when the body is falling asleep; we should exercise our decisions based on our own observations, not those of others, and initiate stable relationships founded on affection, not imagination. This is the lifestyle of enlightenment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome you all with my love and respects. Today we are starting the Nirahara samyama 2nd level. Hundreds of people all over the world are starting the Nirahara samyama 2nd level and I am also starting my \"THE Samyama\". Yesterday whole day and night I felt as if I have done a mistake. Yesterday I ate little solid food. I really felt 'Oh God!' Something like the body was not settling.. Then I decided, come on! Now body is back to Nirahara frequency. No more aahaaraa. No more food.\n\nContinuously the brahmacharya kriya requests are pouring from all over the world. So many want to become brahmacharis. Then why do you guys are sitting in your house and destroying your family? God!\n\n6th chapter Dhyana yoga 17th verse.\n\n       yuktaahaara vihaarasya yukta ceshtasya karmasu\n\n       yukta svapnaavabodhasya yogo bhavati dukhaha\n\nOne who is diligent in eating food or in enjoyment, please understand, one who is diligent means only the quantity needed for your body not needed for your tongue. One who is diligent in eating means do not allow your tongue to make decisions. Most of your time, in your eating your body does not play any role. Only your visualization, you visualize that dosa, soft idli, the moment you visualize, your eyes visualization, your nose smell, your tongue taste, come on, come on, get, get, get. Your body says, no, no, no, I don't need. Body has no hunger. Then mind comes, no, no, you don't know. Now if you don't eat you will feel hungry after 3-4 hours. That time I will be travelling. I will be taking class. I will be in the program. I am telling you, usually argument goes on. This is the way it will be. For you it will be different. It will say, Hey! After few hours you will not find a hotel. You will not find food. Now itself eat. But the moment you sit in front of the plate, you lost the game.\n\nA sadhu who falls in the bed with opposite gender and a sadhu who falls in front of a food plate is one and the same. The moment your mind comes in and justifies and you sit in front of the plate, Over! Your life is destroyed. Let your eating be based on body means let the visualizations not instigate you. Especially these non-veg people, the moment they see the photograph of that chicken, all these, that, that's it. For Andhra people, this avakka ooruka, let your visualization not be a instigator or decision maker of your food.\n\n                yuktaahaara vihaarasya yukta ceshtasya karmasu\n\nDiligent in eating. Please understand, the word diligent means 3 things.\n\n1. Let your visualization or smelling capacity, one more thing, please understand, just like the moment you are able to visualize, your other senses respond. For example, if you visualize food, your tongue responds. If you visualize the opposite gender your body responds. If your senses respond due to your visualization it is called perversion. Same way the moment you visualize certain food, your nostrils, your nose responds, means feels its smell. Your nose feels the smell. Dangerous. When your smell gets into the perversion, please understand, sometimes certain perfume smell can immediately instigate the feeling of food or feeling of lust in you. It is unfortunate the perversions become decision makers in your life.\n\nI tell you, when your body wants food and you eat, it will be diligent. When your body feels the lust, if you unite, it will be embodiment of love. Without the second layer instigator, if you decide, it will always lead you to fulfillment. Trupti. Unfortunately, all your major decisions are by the pervasion. Understand, this is a very... if you are a boss and making decisions based on different fellows' inputs, you will live like an orphan even in the old age. Nobody will be there around you. Neither you would have built professional relationships nor built personal relationships. Blessed are those who can build both relationships.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4abMFXEO-iA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDorxnYv0K8Pvro2aVPu8hF7e8glg","youtubeID":"4abMFXEO-iA","viewCount":11625,"eventDate":"2012-09-18","duration":1949,"likeCount":275,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"are-you-eating-with-your-head-4abmfxeo-ia"}}
