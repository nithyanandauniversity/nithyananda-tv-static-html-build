The thorough introduction, the users manual is necessary for us to make life really happen for us. Without it, we will only be surviving. Only when we experience third eye,  we will really be alive!\n\nAgamas and Upanishads are the user manual for us - we need to know the science from these scriptures. Paramahamsa Nithyananda shares this science in his YouTube channel.
