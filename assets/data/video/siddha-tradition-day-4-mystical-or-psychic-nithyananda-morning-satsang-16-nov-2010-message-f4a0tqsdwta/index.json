The word psychic is too ordinary, too small to cover the extraordinary happenings by the siddhas,  extraordinary expressions by the siddhas.  He described it as a great miracle science, the science of making extraordinary things into reality. \nAs an example he read a verse that looks like a very funny village verse: \nThere was a gardener and he was a popular guy and went to the pot maker and begged and begged for a pot for 10 months and finally got one pot to pour water for his plants. After getting the pot he took it home to his garden and started dancing and singing, \"I've got a pot, I've got a pot.\" Dancing, dancing, dancing with the ecstasy until the guy finally broke the pot. \nThis is the literal translations. If you do look deep, your individual consciousness, body is the pot, Brahma is the pot maker. For 10 months you begged inside the womb and got this pot. What for? To make a garden, to use this pot and grow a lot of vegetables. But unfortunately after landing you are so excited you got a body and jump around, jump around and forgot the reason for which the body was taken. Jumping around, jumping around until you break the pot, that means destroy this body.\nThe first layer meaning is a simple village song. Second layer is a spiritual truth. Third is what can be revealed to one who is in the consciousness of a siddha.  Only if you experience the consciousness of a siddha can you understand the technology buried in this song.\nA master can move a disciple through these three levels of understanding using siddha techniques. If pot is broken on head of a normal person at the first level of understanding, that shake shock makes the non- mechanical parts of the brain awaken for a long time and move to second level. This is a mystical process embedded in each siddha song. \nZen uses this technique. If a disciple comes at the second level clicks with a truth, the master takes a stick and beats the disciple on the sahasrara chakra, crown part. You may think this is an inhuman activity, it is a technique. Osho used it. Surprising to some that such a sophisticated master used it. The moment a disciple clicks just takes stick and hits on sahasrara chakra and third level gets established.\nIf you keep the pot on the head and break that pot with another pot a very subtle shock needs to be given to the body. Very evolved process, how in every siddha verse how all 3 processes embedded in line. \nParamahamsa Nithyananda is a living enlightened master and a rare incarnation, an avatar who is the spiritual force for our millennium.
