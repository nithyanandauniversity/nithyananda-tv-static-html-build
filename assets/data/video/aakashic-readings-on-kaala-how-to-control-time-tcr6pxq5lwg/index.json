YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE SEED. THE SEED IS WAITING TO FLOWER, TO ACHIEVE ITS COMPLETION AND FULFILLMENT. SO LISTENING AND COGNISING THESE TRUTHS WILL ACHIEVE COMPLETION, FULFILLMENT AND ENLIGHTENMENT. THE FIRST TRUTH: \nKAALA CONTINUOUSLY MEETS YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS NOW. \n IF YOU KEEP YOUR NOW IN INCOMPLETION OR HOPE, IT WILL CONTINUE FOREVER. IF YOU KEEP YOUR NOW IN COMPLETION OR CLARITY, THAT WILL MANIFEST FOREVER. KAALA DOES NOT MEET YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE. HE MEETS YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS NOW IN THE PRESENT. DURING YOUR PRESENT MOMENT, BE IN THE SPACE OF COMPLETION.DO NOT HAVE GUILT OR WORRY. THE OFFICIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS INCOMPLETION, TOWARDS GUILT AND FEAR IS UNCLUTCHING!
