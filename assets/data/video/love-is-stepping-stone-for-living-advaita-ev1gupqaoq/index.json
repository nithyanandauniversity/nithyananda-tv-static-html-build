Isha Upanishad – Verse 7\nyasmin sarvāṇi bhūtany   ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ | \ntatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka   ekatvam anupaśyataḥ  || 7 ||\nIn today’s revelation on Isha Upanishad, Paramahamsa Nithyananda entered into the direct jump-start process of feeling 'oneness, ekatvam' with Existence, which is ‘Loving Advaita’, the science of radiating love. Even if it is calculative love initially, it will give us the confidence to radiate unconditional, selfless love. He further gave heart-filling narrations on Mahadeva’s divine plays or leelas of love in Kailasha and Madurai – Mahadeva’s love current, which are the pure form of expressions of Love.\n \nFor today’s Vakyartha Sadas, he gave the topic for spiritual explorations on: how we forgot many possibilities of love by complaining it is too small and calculated, selfish. How to break the barriers to loving and start LIVING LOVE; as only Loving Advaita leads to Living Advaita.
