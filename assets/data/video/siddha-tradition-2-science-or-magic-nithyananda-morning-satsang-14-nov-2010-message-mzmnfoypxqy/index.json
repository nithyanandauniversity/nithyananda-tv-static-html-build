He said the tradition is science, and It means it is Extraordinary, something really Extraordinary which you may not be able to replicate. \nJust like Ganges civilization, there was a civilization happening around the Kaveri River. One fortune thing about the Kaveri, it was flowing in hills and intense dense forest.  Because of this, the civilization happened in hills and forest and river so naturally the knowledge, technology, evolved in such a way a lot of wisdom, siddha tradition, truth about herbs and plants started happening. All the extraordinary achievements and Extraordinary discoveries happened in the Kaveri civilization that organized and systematized, evolved as a system, tradition by a group of mystics and masters called siddhas. \nThese siddhas are able to play with their mind as a tool and do anything they want in the world. And if you see their verses and technology still those medicines are working, those extraordinary powers are happening, the technology they proposed still they awakens the mind. Paramahamsa Nithyananda said there is no expiry date for their technology, these were very powerful people creating very powerful technology and a very powerful tradition. It is so vast he said he was really awestruck and wonderstruck about which part to start teaching to everyone first.  \nHe declared that not only is he going to make the siddha medicine available in shops around the world, he is going to make all the siddha tradition available.\nParamahamsa Nithyananda wants the world to know the siddha tradition is not just a voodoo or something like placebo effect. It's a clear science, portable, anyone can use it. He'll make it a living science. Because it is possible through the vibration that can be stored in the herbs and used.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZMnFOypXqY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDxfy6nDCyWNmxA7lqR98xP1a7_8w","youtubeID":"MZMnFOypXqY","viewCount":10165,"eventDate":"2010-11-21","duration":1458,"likeCount":96,"playlists":{"data":[{"id":"25"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":722,"likeCount":221}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":850,"likeCount":243}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26","duration":395,"likeCount":133}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15","duration":669,"likeCount":187}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14","duration":1760,"likeCount":270}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":871,"likeCount":309}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":375,"likeCount":390}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13","duration":150,"likeCount":386}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1955,"likeCount":759}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09","duration":1924,"likeCount":290}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"siddha-tradition-2-science-or-magic-nithyananda-morning-satsang-14-nov-2010-message-mzmnfoypxqy"}}
