Nithyananda says that Bhakti and Jnana and one and the same. Expressing the gratitude happening because of the spiritual experience is Bhakti. Having the spiritual experience and rejoicing, and staying in the experience is Jnana. Usually people are caught in a vicious circle where fear leads to greed and the greed in turn leading to more and more fear. Vicious circle results in low energy. A Virtuous Circle happens when Bliss due to spiritual experience leads to expression of it as Gratitude/Service and the Gratitude/Service in turn leading to Bliss. The Virtuous Circle leads to high energy and higher and higher levels of consciousness. Dharma is Virtuous Circle.
