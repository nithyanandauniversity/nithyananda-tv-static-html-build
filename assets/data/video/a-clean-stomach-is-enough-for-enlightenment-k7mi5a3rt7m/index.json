The Gita was imparted by the enlightened Hindu incarnation Sri Krishna to the warrior-prince Arjuna over 5000 years ago. Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that it is even today used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4 Verse 35, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) supplies a deeper definition for the term \"clean stomach\". Sri Krishna is not only talking about the physical stomach as is often translated. He actually refers to our hormonal space, to the status of our hormonal equilibrium. When we repeat the experience of internal chemical balance again and again, we create the alchemical shift to a physical state which embraces divine consciousness. This cleansing of our bio-memories -- establishing a \"clean stomach\" -- raises us into the zone of enlightenment.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nLet's start the morning satsang. In Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter, Jnanakarmasanyasa Yoga, 35th verse\n\nYag-naatvaa na punar moham evam yaasyasi paandava\n\nYena bhootaanya-sheshena drakshyas-yaatman-yatho mayi\n\nTranslation :\n\nExperiencing which, O Pandava, you will not have this confusion once again, for you will discern that all life forms, with no exception, are in your own self as they are in me.\n\nIt is such a pleasure to have knowledge bomb every morning. I don't know about you guys, I am having it. Such pleasant space in the morning; I wake up and take bath slowly in my own way. My way of taking bath is -- I need to have water in a huge tub, almost like a, what you need for elephant. Really, I cannot take bath with less quantity water, two bucket, three bucket. No! I can live without food but this cleaning is a big ritual for me. And still I do all the rituals;  aachamaneeyam, everything, and then only I will take bath as prescribed by Manu. Manu says seven times you have to wash after you finish your motion. So seven times I use soap. I'll count. Sometime if I am in hurry, at least seven times I'll touch. And then my taking bath is like a - if you have seen the deity of Amritakateshwara, he will be sitting with two big vessels and pouring on his head. That's the way I'll take bath. Means the whole body will become cool. Now I have one more thing added -- Puja. In this Madurai Adheenam tradition I have to perform Shiv puja every morning. What puja I'll perform? The moment I sit, already in Samadhi! And, but I have my own way. I'll put little vibhooti and little kumkum, little sandal and little water and flower; all that and it'll take two hours for me. Because by the time I put kumkum I'll fall into Samadhi. Then again settle down and pour little water. Anyhow after all that I come and sit here. It's like in pure inner space, a bomb -- a knowledge bomb. This what exactly I want even you guys to experience. Morning have enema so that stomach is clean, take bath, come with a fresh inner space and do the Guru puja. Then this energy bomb, the experience knowledge bomb falls on you. If your stomach is clean, this verse can directly become experience in you. Please understand, Bhagwan says \"O Partha, Pandava, again and again you lose the experience of the ultimate, the remembrance of the ultimate truth. Do not miss that. Have some experience which will remind you to experience the ultimate truth always.\"\n\nSee what is ultimate truth here -- Bhagwan says very clearly -- all life forms are part of your own self. That is the ultimate truth. Bhagwan says you forget again and again this truth because of confusion.\n\nHere Bhagwan is using word Moham. Na Aham is Naaham. Ma Aham is Moham. You surrendering yourself is Naaham. Namaha - Naaham. You being destroyed is Moham. Ma Aham -- Moham.\n\nIf a horse comes and sits at your feet and obeys your command it is Naaham. Na Aham -- surrendering. You just throw a bomb at a horse and it dies and falls -- that is Moham. Ma Aham.\n\nThe key word in this verse is Moham - Ma Aham. Bhagwan says 'All life forms are part of you'. This is the ultimate truth. But you again and again forget this truth because of Moham. Moham word should not be understood as a lust or greed. Please understand lust or greed is only the bomb. That is not Moham. Moham means destroying yourself - the confusion. Bhagwan says the Moham, the confusion takes away this truth - All life forms are part of you. It is being taken away from you again and again -- Punah Punaha. He says get into some experience which will not take away that ultimate from you again and again. It's a very subtle subject -- please listen intensely step by step. First all life forms are part of me. This is the truth. Now once you understand that sometimes you feel that, yes, if you take a handful of clay; if this is clay, If I understand this clay, if I know this clay thoroughly, then I know all the clay on the planet Earth thoroughly.","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7mI5A3rt7M/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDn47aGGo0vtf5avJ1I6Xye6VkhJw","youtubeID":"K7mI5A3rt7M","viewCount":62882,"eventDate":"2012-05-28","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"3"},{"id":"33"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"a-clean-stomach-is-enough-for-enlightenment-k7mi5a3rt7m"}}
