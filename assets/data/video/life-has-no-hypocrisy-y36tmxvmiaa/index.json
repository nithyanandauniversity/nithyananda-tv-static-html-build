Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains how when we are caught in fear and greed, life is about possessing and controlling; wealth handled with incompletion is possessiveness, power is controlling. When you are authentic in empowering people, in any field, you will become more powerful in that field - teach others what you know, from a complete space. Life has no hypocrisy!\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTS:-\n\nUPANISHADS!  Let us chant the Shanthi Mantra which I am expanding on and enter into the science of applying that mantra in our life.\n\nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते |\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||\n|| ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ||\n \nOm Poornamadhah Poornamidham Poornaath Poornam Udhachyathey |\nPoornasya Poornamaadhaaya Poornamevaavasishyathey ||\n|| Om Shanthi Shanthi Shanthih ||\n \nWhen I am trying to expand on Upanishads, even I feel I am not using enough words!  It is like it is not adequate.  Saraswathi may be eloquent, but not adequate to translate the silence of Mahadeva.  Translating the silence of Mahadeva, even Saraswathi feels inadequate!  She may be eloquent in front of anything, but inadequate in front of Mahadeva’s silence.  Upanishads are Mahadeva’s silence.  Translating that into words!  It is only by Mahadeva’s grace I can translate, translate, translate his silence into words and deliver, understand?\n\nI was expanding on the concept of “nation” and “desha” (“देश” ).  When decision-makers, whether in the field of business or ruling, when decision-makers are out of fear and greed, it is all about producing in mass and sharing with the world.  When the decision-makers are caught in fear and greed, then it is all going to be about possessing and controlling.  Wealth, handled with incompletion, will lead to possessiveness.  Power, handled with incompletion, will become controlling.  A powerless man, when he is given power, he will only be controlling.  A poor man, when he is given wealth, he will only be possessing.  A poor man does not even know how to live with wealth, I am telling you.  He will just make a big godown, iron godown, a thick wall iron godown, put everything inside, and lock it, and sleep on it!  That’s all!  And die!  Is this the purpose of wealth?  And his whole life he will spend worrying, ‘Will anybody know what I am keeping under my bed?  And will anybody steal it?’  A poverty-conscious man, even if he stumbles on wealth, he cannot live it.  A poor man, incomplete man, even if he sees wealth, he is not going to enjoy it, live it.  He may possess it, but he may not live it!  Same way, a powerless man, frightened, fear-based person, even if he is given power, he will only be controlling it, he will not be expanding it.  A person established in Completion, in the space of Completion, even if he does not have wealth, he knows how to create and live.  A person based on Completion, even with the small powers which are available to him, he knows how to enrich people with power.  Enriching people with power!\n\nCompletion-based lifestyle!  I am telling you, constantly empower yourself!  Constantly empower yourself!  Constantly empower yourself!  Have power and go on empowering people with power.  And, I tell you, in which ever field you empower people, you will only become more and more powerful.  Only by producing more musicians, you will become a great musician.  Only by producing more dancers, you will become a great dancer!  Only by producing more doctors, you will become a great doctor!  Only by producing more rich people, you will become a richer person!  Only by producing more leaders, you will be a great leader!  Only by producing more enlightened beings, you will be an INCARNATION!\n\nEmpowering people!  Empowering people!  Empowering can happen only if you feel powerful, complete inside.  If you feel incomplete, empowering does not happen.  I tell you, life has no hypocrisy!  Life has no hypocrisy!\n\nLINK FOR FULL TRANSCRIPTS:- video/life-has-no-hypocrisy#gsc.tab=0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/y36tMxvmIaA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"y36tMxvmIaA","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"},{"id":"34"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"life-has-no-hypocrisy-y36tmxvmiaa"}}
