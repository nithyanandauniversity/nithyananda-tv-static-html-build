It is also important to work at least 12 hours a day being productive or involved in social service. An empty mind is the devil's workshop. A lazy body is the devil's residence. Orthodox translations tell you to reduce activity. Some of these Vedantis stop living and are just waiting for death. But when you unclutch you start living. \n\nUltimate aligning to the awakening happens through intense work. Seva is the highest form of creativity. When you align to the understanding, even your words will serve the society. Meditate on the infinite continuously, keep on unclutching. Make it as a process, a spiritual practice.\n\nEvery action releases some engrams from your system. When the Kundalini is awakened, all the engrams will leave your system: fear, greed, craving for physical pleasure, fantasies will leave your system by the levitation.\n\nWhen you are encaged by the engrams, you are gravitating, you are pulled down. Scientific research says that for at least 10 diseases, Inner Awakening can be prescribed more than any medicine. Paramahamsa Nithyananda explained, \"I am throwing away all your engrams during the levitation and that's why your body becomes light and you levitate. Your consciousness enters the super-conscious zone, your mind enters the creative zone, your being experiences conscious bliss.\"\n\nAasana, right posture, aligns you to the awakening. Understand the ancient scriptures in the right way. \nHis whole sangha is entering into a new super-conscious zone. A few hundred creative levitators run the mission. When a man experiences Kundalini awakening, he becomes a leader and aligns to the truth; he has less tiredness and fatigue, works smart and becomes unselfish.\n\nParamahamsa Nithyananda concluded, \"I will push the Sangha into the next level-few 1000 enlightened beings. By the tremendous positive explosion though my system, the cosmos is taking revenge on the negativity of the world in a very playful way.\"","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iD4JksOtM4Y/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCiZ99PS6SYP0zygSnVIsXZ3-zt7w","youtubeID":"iD4JksOtM4Y","viewCount":22699,"eventDate":"2011-01-15","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"11"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5249,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":8185,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":3004,"eventDate":"2018-09-26"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":5938,"eventDate":"2018-09-15"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":6439,"eventDate":"2018-09-14"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7606,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":63766,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":15243,"eventDate":"2018-09-13"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":35546,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp","viewCount":7623,"eventDate":"2018-09-09"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"asanasaligning-to-kundalini-awakening-patanjali-yoga-sutra-98-nithyananda-satsang-13-jan-2011-id4jksotm4y"}}
