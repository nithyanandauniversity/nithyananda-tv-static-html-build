Here Is How To Get Rid Of Tiredness and Boredom..","slug":"feeling-tired-or-bored-here-is-how-to-get-rid-of-tiredness-and-boredom-8ajjuhim3s","description":"27 AUGUST 2020\n\n*TODAY PARAMASHIVOHAM SEASON 11 IS STARTING. I INITIATE YOU ALL TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MANIFESTING PARAMASHIVOHAM.\n\n*PARAMASHIVA’S DIRECT MESSAGE FROM KAILASA:\n\n*THE DIMENSION OF THE CHIDABHASA OF THE UNIVERSE IS WHERE THE ACTIVISM OF CHIT - WHAT WE CALL SHAKTI, AND THE ABSOLUTE PURE EXISTENTIAL REALITY OF CHIT - WHAT WE CALL PARAMAPURUSHA, BOTH TOGETHER - IN ITS PURE BEING SPACE AND INTENSE DOING SPACE.\n\n*THAT SPACE OF CHIDABHASA IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THESE 5 DIMENSIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, LENGTH, BREADTH, DEPTH, TIME AND SPACE.\n\n*BECAUSE MODERN DAY SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO USE TWO DIFFERENT WORDS - TIME AND SPACE, I AM ALSO USING THE SAME WAY. BUT IN REALITY, TIME AND SPACE IS A SINGLE SHEET. ONE EDGE IS TIME, AND ANOTHER EDGE IS SPACE.\n\n*IT IS NOT A WATERTIGHT COMPARTMENT. LIKE I SAID, FOR SOME PEOPLE, IN THE SAME 100 METER CLOTH, 70 METER WILL BE TIME, 30 METER WILL BE SPACE. FOR SOME, 30 METER TIME, 70 METER SPACE. THE TIME-SPACE IS THE SAME SHEATH (AVARANA).\n\n*YOU SHOULD MASTER THIS TIME AND SPACE CONTINUUM. IT IS SIMPLE, IT IS NOT COMPLICATED.\n\n*MANY THINGS WHICH IS TOO SIMPLE, WE WANT TO JUST COMPLICATE IT; IT IS JUST SHEER ARROGANCE OR SUICIDAL MODE WHICH MAKES YOU SAY, ‘IT IS LIKE THIS ONLY, WHAT CAN BE DONE…?’\n\n*IT IS WHAT IS CALLED PANDEMIC FATIGUE AND THE DELUSIONAL ARROGANCE WHICH I WAS DESCRIBING.\n\n*TIREDNESS STARTS YOUR DESTRUCTION.\n\n*WHEN YOU START ASSOCIATING YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA OF TIREDNESS, AND WHEN YOU DECLARE YOUR TIREDNESS, YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD BE TREATED VERY CUTELY. THAT IS WHEN THE DESTRUCTION STARTS IN THE LIFE.\n\n*TIREDNESS IS SICKNESS. YOU NEED TO BE HANDLED FEROCIOUSLY. OTHERWISE, IT WILL BECOME DEPRESSION. TIREDNESS AND CUTE TEDDY BEAR CUDDLY FEELING WITH TIREDNESS IS DEPRESSION.\n\n*WHEN PEOPLE TREAT YOU CUTELY WITH TEDDY BEAR CUDDLY BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU ARE TIRED, BE VERY CLEAR YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN DEPRESSION AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH YOU CUTELY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DEPRESSION.\n\n*WHEN YOU DECLARE YOUR TIREDNESS, YOU NEED KALABHAIRAVA TO DEAL WITH YOU, FEROCIOUSLY WAKE YOU UP.\n\n*BOREDOM LEADS TO SUICIDAL TENDENCIES; TIREDNESS LEADS TO DEPRESSION.\n\n*IF YOU ARE FEELING TIRED, TAKE A CUP OF COFFEE, DO SOME YOGA AND BREAK YOUR TIREDNESS.\n\n*TIREDNESS EVOLVES AS CHRONIC FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION IN YOUR SYSTEM.\n\n*THAT IS WHY I INSIST ON EVERYDAY INTENSE YOGA. IT IS THE BEST WAY. IF YOU ARE GOING FOR WORK, AT LEAST ONE HOUR YOGA. IF YOU ARE WORKING FROM HOME, 2 HOURS YOGA, TO KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE.\n\n*YOGA IS LIKE NEEM JUICE. ONCE YOU START ENJOYING IT, IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL THING.\n\n*A PERSON WHO ENJOYS ONLY THROUGH THE TONGUE IS ROGI (SICK). YOU WILL EAT, GRAB, SWALLOW EVERYTHING WHICH MAKES YOU SICK JUST BECAUSE IT TASTES VERY GOOD HERE (TONGUE).\n\n*PERSON WHO ENJOYS USING THE WHOLE INTESTINE IS YOGI. ANYTHING WHICH DOES GOOD TO YOUR INTESTINE AND WHOLE SYSTEM, IF YOU START ENJOYING IT, YOU ARE YOGI.\n\n*WITH HUNGER - LANGANAM - FASTING, YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE INTESTINE BURNING, NICELY HEALING ITSELF, DETOXING ITSELF, CLEANING ITSELF. IF YOU START ENJOYING THAT, YOU ARE A YOGI.\n\n*IN INDIA, FOOD AND LOVE IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED. IF YOU GO TO YOUR FRIENDS’ AND FAMILY’S HOUSE, ATTEND SOME CEREMONY AND FESTIVAL, ESPECIALLY IN A VILLAGE LIKE TIRUVANNAMALAI, WHERE EVERYDAY, SOME OLD PERSON WILL DIE, SOMEONE WILL GET MARRIED, SOMEONE WILL HAVE 13TH DAY CEREMONY AND THE FUNNY THING IS, THE WHOLE VILLAGE IS EXPECTED TO ATTEND, YOU HAVE TO EAT THERE. AND IF YOU DON’T ATTEND, THEY WON'T COME FOR YOUR CEREMONY!\n\n*BUT YOU CAN’T ALSO LEAVE IT LIKE THAT. THEY WILL SEND SOMEONE TO YOUR HOUSE FUNCTION, TO COME AND POKE YOU AND REMIND YOU: ‘BECAUSE YOU DID NOT COME, THEY DID NOT COME,’ AND DESTROY YOUR FESTIVE MOOD! SO IT IS A COMPULSORY OBLIGATION!\n\n*AND IF YOU GO, YOU HAVE TO EAT. IF YOU DON'T EAT, IT IS THE NEXT LEVEL CRIME!\n\n*MY GURU, YOGANANDA PURI, WHEN DEVOTEES FORCE HIM TO EAT SOMETHING IN THIS KIND OF SOCIAL FUNCTIONS AND CEREMONIES, IMMEDIATELY AFTER EATING, HE WILL COME TO HIS HOUSE, DRINK SALT WATER, MAKE SURE HE VOMITS THE WHOLE THING, ONLY THEN HE WILL REST. IT IS A YOGIC KRIYA: DRINKING SALT WATER AND VOMITING.\n\n*HE USED TO TELL VERY CLEARLY, “YOU SHOULD TASTE, EAT AND ENJOY WHAT IS ENJOYED BY THE WHOLE INTESTINE, NOT WHAT IS ENJOYED BY THE MOUTH.”\n\nREAD MORE AT: https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda/posts/4279576002130217","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8AJj_uhim3s/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCQkBqvlRZQNRnISsGelzPkH3-oLw","youtubeID":"8AJj_uhim3s","playlists":{"data":[{"id":"19"}]}}}]},"playlists":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","slug":"popular-videos","videos":{"data":[{"attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","slug":"shivoham-process-purifying-sounds-and-visualizations-in-the-mind-and-body-cff2vuroro4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cff2VurORO4/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Let Wealth Be a Side-Effect of Your Spirituality","slug":"let-wealth-be-a-side-effect-of-your-spirituality-hsskrssjvcu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HSSkrSSJvCU/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kailash - Spiritual Energy Center of the Universe, The Breathing Space of Shiva","slug":"kailash-spiritual-energy-center-of-the-universe-the-breathing-space-of-shiva-xwtqzvembn0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XwtQZVeMbn0/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anything is Worthy of Giving Up To Be Established in The Supreme Self","slug":"anything-is-worthy-of-giving-up-to-be-established-in-the-supreme-self-zhecyrqqdbe","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zHecyrQqDbE/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Anger is Neither Good Nor Bad, It is Pure Energy","slug":"anger-is-neither-good-nor-bad-it-is-pure-energy-jrhkzpkawwm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JrHKZpKAwWM/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Extraordinary Experiences of Yoga | Autobiography of The Avatar","slug":"extraordinary-experiences-of-yoga-or-autobiography-of-the-avatar-jh5zut5pyzk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jh5zUt5pyzk/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Haritaki - The Most Praised, Amazing Herb from Ayurveda","slug":"haritaki-the-most-praised-amazing-herb-from-ayurveda-dj2xulgnsps","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dJ2XULGnSps/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Awakening Kundalini Shakti Using Trikona Mandala","slug":"awakening-kundalini-shakti-using-trikona-mandala-1voufcoivho","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VOufcOiVHo/maxresdefault.webp"}},{"attributes":{"title":"Kalabhairava & The 64 Forms of Shiva, Marvels of Temple Architecture","slug":"kalabhairava-and-the-64-forms-of-shiva-marvels-of-temple-architecture-6om7s2tsyjm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6OM7S2TSYjM/maxresdefault.webp"}}]}}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"feeling-tired-or-bored-here-is-how-to-get-rid-of-tiredness-and-boredom-8ajjuhim3s"}}
