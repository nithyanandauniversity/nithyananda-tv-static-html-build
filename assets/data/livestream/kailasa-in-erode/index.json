It is in Tiruchengode, on the banks of the sacred Cauvery river (Tamilnadu, South India), He erected this temple-monastery complex on His own blood and sweat. From there started the revival and re-establishment of KAILASA on the planet. It culminated in establishing of the only Hindu Nation in the world – “KAILASA”. It is a saga of hard work that can never be told fully and it continues amidst the persecuting forces.\n\nThe Avatār named the KAILASA – “Ramakrishna Dhyanapeetam”, paying tribute to the great Indian Saint Sri Ramakrishna, a great source of inspiration to The Avatār. The Avatār spent four austere years in monkhood in Sri Ramakrishna Mutt in Chennai and Calcutta (1995 – 1999). It is here that He also consecrated the first Shiva Linga of KAILASA. The worship altar was inaugurated with Sri Ramakrishna, his Divine Consort Sarada Devi, his chief disciple Swami Vivekananda, and the first ever Shiva Linga consecrated by The Avatār.","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/kailasa_nithyananda_tv_og_d5d75dd641.jpg"}}},"embedUrl":"https://player.twitch.tv/?kailasainerode"}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kailasa-in-erode"}}
