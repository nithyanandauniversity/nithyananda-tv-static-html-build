The vast umbrella of this ancient tree encloses a space resonant with spiritual energies. It is under this umbrella the majestic deity of Dakshinamurti resides, the first-ever Guru, imparting the deepest spiritual truths to his disciples in silence.\n\nOver the years, this sacred space has acquired a powerful reputation for healing, wish-fulfillment and awakening spiritual clarity, and draws visitors and seekers from around the world. The vibrations in this space are so distinct that even the casual visitor can feel its effects.\n\nThe sacred banyan tree is a Kalpavriksha (boon giving tree) that has manifested scores of sincere prayers till date. At the base of the banyan tree is a cave-like hollow in which was found a Swayambhu Lingam (naturally formed Shiva Lingam), which has now been consecrated at the Nithyanandeshwara Paramashiva Devalayam. The cave and the Swayambhu Lingam have been here for centuries, having been personally worshipped by Sri Rama Chandra Prabhu during His exile. Over 1000 years, the banyan tree has grown and spread its foliage here. Impregnated with healing energy, this space heals at the physical, emotional and spiritual levels. Beneath the banyan tree, lies the Jeeva Samadhis of two incarnations of HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam Himself.\n\nHere, one can find three trees: Athi (holy Fig), Ala (Banyan) and Arasa (Peepal), known to bear fruits without bearing flowers. In the Vedic tradition, these are sacred trees, known as Vanaspati or ‘Lord of the forest’. It is said that Paramashiva resides in the place where these three trees are found together.","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/kalpataru_f16d9fc7db.jpg"}}},"embedUrl":"https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=tvnithyananda"}}]}}},"context":{"slug":"kalpataru"}}
