Nithyananda defines reality as the projection of our inner space onto the outer world. If we have internal conflict, our wishes manifest as contradictory and our experience of reality is confused. Once we bring integrity to our inner space, the universe rushes to fulfill our dreams. Whatever we project on the cosmos becomes a project for the cosmos!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI will expand on how the first principle of life Sampoorthi LISTEN! First principle of life integrity supports you in transforming your life as you want, manifesting the reality as you want. Manifesting your reality as you want. So let me define integrity once again. Integrity is you fulfilling the word/thought you give it to yourself and to others and to experiencing the state of completion with yourself and life. LISTEN!\n\nLet me also define reality. Reality means - Projecting your life in the outer workd also as you want in the inner world because there is no discrepancy between the inner world and outer world experiencing the truth of non-duality. Advaita is reality. LISTEN! In the inner world not having any conflict or contradiction about what you want and projecting that experiencing it without any conflict or contradiction in the outer world also because there is no conflict or contradiction in the inner world and between inner world and outer world experiencing non duality as flow of your very life is Reality. I will translate in hindi about sampoorthi.\n\nPhele jeevan ka phehala tatva Sampoorthi ki paribasha punaha suniye. Sampoorthi ka arth hai -- app swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye hue vichaar ivam vakya ko purna kare aur swayam ivam jeevan  ke saath purnatva siti ka anubhav kare\n\nNow let me expand on reality so that you understand how the four principles be used to make reality as you want. Let me define what is reality. This is a very important definition. Only when you experience this as your reality you can have experience Bramhanyam Bahuputratam! LISTEN\n\nNot having any conflict internally and contradictions internally about what you want to experience as your inner world and outer world and projecting it powerfully so powerfully that there is no conflict between your projection and your experience perception, no conflict no contradiction. Because there is no conflict and contradiction inside what do you want and outside what you are experiencing feeling the non-duality - Advaita is Reality. First thing inside itself there is so much of conflict, contradiction, what you really want inside you, outside you. What you really want inside you, outside you. That itself has so much of conflict. Second because there is a conflict inside what you project is not able to move the outside the way you want. Because when you say you want money, one part of you already says No..No.. I will ask but you don't give. Because of the conflict, contradictions, unconsciousness inside what you project also has conflict, contradictions and  unconsciousness outside, because of that the outside world also has unconsciousness , conflict and contradictions,. This is what I call un-reality. The confusion of Dwandwa -- duality. I'll translate in hindi.\n\nVaastavikta ka arth hai -- ki aap apne antharik stiti ko apke baahar istarah vyakt karne ni ki, aap apke andar ayam baahar koyi bhi sangarsh anubhav na kare. Aisi bina dwanda ki stiti arthartha advaita stiti ko anubhav karna hi Vaastavika ka arth hai\n\nVaastavikta kya hai -- aap ke beetar ki duniya mein sangarshan na ho, hona aivam us anubhav ko baahar ki duniya mein darshana. Kyoi ki na hi bitar ki sangharshan ki hai aur na hi bitar or bahar ki duniya mein sangarshan nahi hai iskaran jeevan ke pravaha me advaita ka anubhav karna yahi vaastavikta hai.\n\nLISTEN!\n\nFirs you being clear within you. How much of wealth you need, how much of responsibilities you need to take for it, what is the way you want to feel you, what is the way you want to project you to others, what all the other ways may perceive you.

Completion with you makes the possibility for creating new, new diseases disappears. All the diseases you create newly is from the source of incompletion. Integrity stops you creating new, new diseases. Authenticity heals even the diseases you created earlier. When you start thinking with Integrity, with awareness, every word you give to you becomes commitment you give to you. It means, every desire you have is a commitment you have given to you. When you know every word you give to you is a commitment you make with yourself and you have to honor them, you will make only conscious commitments to you, conscious words to you. The conflicts in the life will drastically drop, the conflicts in the life will drastically drop. Success happens in life, fulfillment happens in life when the conflicts reduce. When the conflicts reduce, life energy starts oozing in you. Bringing Integrity with others is the only way relationships can be created, and it is not long-term process, long-term solution; it is immediate solution, permanent solution.

You are not aware of what is happening inside you. When you bring integrity in your thinking, first thing you will know what is happening inside you. Integrity makes you feel comfortable with you because the completion makes you feel comfortable with you. The words you give it to you if you have not honored they remain as a hangover in you and continues to burn you with incompletion.  If you don't honor the words you give it to you, you lose self confidence and self respect. If you don't honor the word you give it to others you will lose others confidence over you, their respect over you.\n\nListen everything in your life is totality of  honoring the words you give it to you and to others because the respect you carry for you and the respect others carry for you, the confidence others have for you and the confidence you have on you, these two put together is your life.","slug":"get-a-permanent-solution-kc72es3b9oc","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kc72ES3b9oc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"kc72ES3b9oc"}},{"id":"356","attributes":{"title":"Change Your Past to Change Your Future","description":"In today's morning satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda reminds his followers that there is no such thing as impossibility. The concept of failure is founded on our edited past memories. Completing with the past clears our destiny for a clean future in which we understand that everything is possible. If we allow a project to fail it is because we do not implement it with integrity. If others reject our project it is because they sense our inauthenticity. Complete authenticity acts as a magnet: it attracts an authentic response in others and leads them to have confidence in us. Nithyananda addresses the attitude of limiting a project by assessing whether it is practical. Practicality is based only on our past experiences of limitation. When we dispense with practicality our horizon becomes infinite. We should not live even one day without making one thing possible that seems impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday we will start the satsang with the subject Integrity. Bhoopathi in Mettur Dhyanapeetam blessings for your daughter's valayakaapu. Listen. By nature God built you with integrity.\n\nYour in built innate nature is integrity. That is why you are so fulfilled....\n\nFor example,you are thinking....when these  non  .....listen. When there is a  knot   in the thought, you are ready  for a failure.\n\nNon-integrity first quality is you will feel everything is impossible. Everyone should know if \"I\" am possible, If  \"I\" can exist, nothing is impossible! Impossible itself is \"I am possible!\" No the lack of integrity is first thing... diagnosis for lack of integrity. How there is diagnosis for each disease if you feel giddy it can be low BP,  if you  have  continuous knee pain it can be arthritis. When you feel continuously impossible in your life, you are suffering from a disease called lack of integrity. You need to sit and complete with you.  A  situation  failing, you failing, your idea of you failing, please listen - situation failing, you failing, your idea of you failing - all this three is nothing but perverted integrity. Not only lack of integrity, you are integrated to your perversion. Listen. In the flesh and blood which is matter, consciousness growing is the greatest miracle. When I is possible, how can anything be impossible. I know you are not convinced because you don't know the science. I know the science that is why I am telling you. Your body is after all just a flesh and blood. Your brain is nothing special. Many don't have brain. Even if they have it is just some fat and muscle put in a confused way. But consciousness is being experienced. This is the highest miracle I tell you.  When that miracle is possible, how can anything be impossible?  The ideas you carry about your old failures. I tell you every idea you carry about your past is wrong. Before changing your future, change your past. Unless you change your past, you cannot change your future. Immediately you think how can i change my past? it has happened already. No. The idea you carry about your past is completely wrong. You are not carrying it as it happened. You are carry it in the edited created version....all the sound effect, volume  effect, music effect. Please listen. With all my experience I tell you. Yesterday I changed one important statement. People usually tell you how much ever you listen, unless you can practice you will not achieve it. I said now I am telling an important statement. People usually say don't bother about past, change the future. I tell you don't bother about future, change your past because your future lies in your past. Change your past. The hangover you carry about the past is the disease you are carrying and unless you complete your past, you cannot transform...\n\n\nI tell you the load of your past perverted integrity is prison. Making whatever you think as impossible into possibility is integrity. The idea impossible is nothing but lack of integrity. Why anything will not be possible? Not only when i say something, even in your life, you cannot h ave this in your constitution. Please understand. The conscious constitution. The word impossible cannot exist even in your conscious constitution. There is nothing called impossible. It is the weight of the past. Their logic seems to be very strong.","slug":"change-your-past-to-change-your-future-acvsfqkakac","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/AcvSFQkaKAc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"AcvSFQkaKAc"}},{"id":"357","attributes":{"title":"A Life Without Fear is Possible (Part 1)","description":"In the morning satsang of 25 February 2013, Paramahamsa Nithyananda discusses the nature of inauthenticity. Anything we fear in life is something we are inauthentic about. For example, if we fear death we have the inauthentic belief that we are immortal. Fear-free life is possible when we become completely authentic. Greed-free life is also possible when we are in a state of complete integrity. Worry disappears when we assume responsibility, and the need for attention is dissolved when we reach out to enrich others. Once we resolve these problems related to the four lower chakras, enlightenment simply blossoms.\n\nDelivered on 25th February 2013 part1 of 2 to a live global audience by Paramahamsa Nithyananda","slug":"a-life-without-fear-is-possible-part-1-z-hgzdobaaw","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/z-HGZDOBAaw/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"z-HGZDOBAaw"}},{"id":"358","attributes":{"title":"Love Makes Life Happen to you","description":"In today's morning satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda describes the way in which integrity transforms relationships. When human beings bring integrity into their inner space they create permanent change. Those around them no longer see the former personality, and interactions become fresh and spontaneous. Healing follows as the old ways of relating are discarded and forgotten. Once integrity is infused into relationship, individuals discover that they are no longer limited to a narrow boundary of toleration: they can relate easily to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI will expand on how the integrity and authenticity expands your relationships and enriches you to have fulfillment.\n\nDhyan se suniye, first I wanted to make this three statements, one, relationship does not mean only the few human beings who live around you. When I use the word relationship I mean the relationship with your health, with your money, with your life, with the success, with the nature, everything.\n\nSecond, you also have a very inauthentic way of dreaming about your life - just to have a few cozy relationships around you and that is enough you are complete with your relationships and relationship dimension; which is completely wrong and inauthentic.\n\nThird, please listen, third only when you expand you to the level with integrity and authenticity anything, anybody comes in your breathing space, there is a conflict free complete relationship. You are going to experience fulfillment and success. Relationship is not related to the quantity it is related to the quality. Please listen, the third statement takes the concept of relationship completely to the different level altogether.\n\nLet us start from the beginning.\n\nSampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nPunahsuniye, Sampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nI will expand on these principles. When you bring integrity you will heal all the broken relationships, the conflicts which you create and created in the past; listen, creating in the present and created in the past, gets healed when you bring integrity. Let me repeat this 3 statements I made then you will understand one by one.\n\nPehle mein aapko teen cheezhe bathana chahtha hoon. Sambandh ka arth keval aapke aaspaas ke manushyon se sambandhith nahi hain. Jab mein sambandh shabd ka upayog kartha hoon, mera arth hain sabhi sambandhon se hain aap ka swasthya, paisa, jeevan, safaltha, prakruthi, sabhi.\n\nListen you need to understand the principle of relationship in larger context. Any conflict experienced in your inner space reminds you your inauthenticities in relationships. When you have the idea relationships are just nothing but what you experience with few people, you have very narrow, low, view and ideas. Listen aap apne jeevan mein in sabhi cheezon se sambandh rakhthe hain anya log, dhan vyapaar swasthya ithyadi; dhan vyaapaar swaasthya ithyaadi\n\nWhen you bring integrity you will heal all the damage you caused inside you, outside you due to the relationships, the ignorance you had in the zone of relationships. Listen your ignorance in the space of relationships not only causes damage in others, it causes damage in you also. When you cause damage in your spouse, in your mother, in your father, be very clear you cause damage in you; because your father, mother, spouse, all the relationships you carry decides the confidence and the energy you have about you.","slug":"love-makes-life-happen-to-you-zjyftcjgrm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZJYftcjGR_M/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"ZJYftcjGR_M"}},{"id":"359","attributes":{"title":"Enriching Makes you an Incarnation","description":"In today's morning satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains the science of integrity. Integrity is the mathematics of life. When we declare completion on our negative commitments we get 'zero remainder': our future is freed from our past. Authenticity is the biology of life and can have independent intelligence. Responsibility is the engineering of life: it is like science fiction becoming reality. Responsibility generates miracles: it was responsibility that led the Buddha to enlightenment. Enriching is the constitution of life: when we enrich others we establish our own legislation. Life flows as we ordain it to be.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I will expand on the great principle of life -- RESPONSIBILITY and ENRICHING.\n\nPlease listen! How these principles expand your consciousness and help you to achieve what you want to achieve, help you to decide what you want to achieve. \n\nPlease listen!            \n\n·  Integrity is MATHEMATICS of Life.\n\n·  Authenticity is BIOLOGY of Life.\n\n·  Responsibility is SCIENCE of Life.\n\n·  Enriching is CONSTITUTION of Life.\n\nIntegrity is Mathematics of Life. It is simple, straight-forward Mathematics. If you add all this, this, this -- this is result. You can simply practice it like Mathematics. \n\nMany a time, I can see, a human-being if he is not going to be inspired by the spiritual truths, he is going to be inspired only by fear. Sometimes, people have become so selfish, they bother only about their personal pleasure or pain. When the life hits at them there, only then they understand the Constitution of Life, Constitution of the Cosmos, not otherwise. If you have become sensitive enough to understand life and the facts and the truth, the Cosmos does not teach you in a very hard way; it teaches you in a simple, mild way. If you don't come back to Integrity, the Cosmos continues to torture you. No other way! Because Integrity is a simple Mathematics of the Life!(2:45 to 3:21)\n\nIntegrity is Mathematics of Life. If you add two negative statements, commitments to your thinking, you will have two negative happenings. If you repeat a negative, commitment hundreds of times, it will be strong, equivalent to hundred times! So, you have to complete till your negative commitments are completed and dropped. But, even if you have millions of negativitY, if you just make it \"into zero\" (multiply it by zero), or divide it by zero, the whole thing will become zero! Master's initiation is either dividing it or \"into(x) zero\"! It is equivalent to dividing it by zero. The whole thing will become zero. \n\nI am teaching you the Mathematics of Life. You need to listen intensely. Integrity Every negativeS commitment you give to you is alive!  Every negative commitments you give it to you is alive! Each negative commitments has to be nullified. Till it is nullified, it continues to give fruit. It is simple Mathematics! Bringing integrity to you is simple mathematics(5:08 to 6:22)I can also tell you one more thing even you declaring completion can be like adding  dividing your negative commitments with zero, dividing your negative commitments with zero so even if you built millions of negative commitments if you divide it by zero it will become zero So, your declaration of Integrity is like dividing all your past negativity by zero, or multiplying by zero. When you multiply it by zero, it lands into zero. Listen if you divide it by zero even if your negative commitments land into infinity it will become positive because in negativity there is no infinity darkness can never be infinite light can be infinite negative can never be infinite only positive can be infinite because infinity needs to exist negativity does not exist.     \n\nIntegrity when you practice, you will see like Mathematics immediately the benefit will be seen.  Literally like Mathematics! \n\nAuthenticity is Biology. If you start practicing Authenticity, it takes a few days for it to become your bio-memory and the result to happen in your day-to-day life.  But once it starts happening, it is like once something becomes your bio-memory, you can't remove it. Even if you miss it a few times, you don't miss the good things happening outside you. You can get back to Authenticity.  But Integrity, even if you miss once for example if you practice integrity for 20 years even if you miss once and give a negative commitment, it will be a reality till you drop it, till you complete it. It is a simple Mathematics! Integrity has no independent life.  But Authenticity gets into the space of life and matter like Biology.  Authenticity goes a deep, a step further. It is beyond maths beyond biology science of life it is engineering of life you can build anything you want you can achieve anything you want you can achieve many things you not even started imagining till now many things in your life you have not even started imagining till now you can achieve those things !

When we are looking to gain acceptance, respect, or act out of fear, we are not practicing integrity. The right reason to practice integrity is to be complete with time and heal. Authenticity is the individual soul's struggle to get back to the source and live in continuous expansion. Like a child who lost his mother, his only motive is to find his mother. Same way, we have an innate tendency to reach Mother; the Cosmic Soul. Responsibility is not working to become powerful but knowing we already ARE powerful and the source of everything happening around us. Enriching happens once you realize everyone is part of you. So each being you enrich, is enriching a part of you also; when they feel complete, part of you will be complete.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I will expand on 'RIGHT REASONS FOR COMPLETION AND PRACTICING THE FOUR PRINCIPLES -- INTEGRITY, AUTHENTICITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND ENRICHING'.\n\nListen.  Right reasons for practicing completion, doing completion and practicing Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching; right reasons for living enlightenment.\n\nUnderstand, we all practice Integrity at some part of our life; but why?  May be afraid of our boss, wife, people around us.  If you practice Integrity because you are afraid of your boss, wife, people around you or you wanted their acceptance; I have seen some people boast, especially the teachers and people in the ex-army, they say, 'last thirty years we were very integrated in the time.'\n\nYes, but for wrong reason, but for wrong reason.  They have been integrated may be for a smaller reason, not with the right reasons, not with the right context. Listen, if you are practicing Integrity just to have acceptance and respect from others, fear of boss, fear of your society, people around you; if you practice Integrity just to have the acceptance from the people around you, yes, you will have acceptance, no doubt, you will have acceptance; but that's all.  You will just have acceptance. \n\nThe right reason, why, why I should practice Integrity: 'to have completion with Time, Kaala'.  Listen, to have completion with Kaala.\n\nI tell you, practice Integrity just for ten days with only reason - completion with Kalabhairava.  He will heal all your past incompletions; because Kaala is a independent energy.  He can just roll back. He is like a Time Machine. He can roll the time. He can bring the past and heal the whole past by his hand, the eternal healing hand.  Listen, eternal healing hand in the world is Kaala, Time.  Time can heal anything which can't be healed. Time can heal everything. All memorials are against the Time. They do not want something to be forgotten; that is why they try to create memorial. Time is such a powerful healer, he can heal everything. I tell you, even your guilt is nothing but a memorials you established for your mistakes and not allowing Kaala to heal.\n\nListen. If a war has happened, the society which was affected by that war tries to establish a memorial or the country who lost lot of soldiers, whether they win or lose in the war, whoever lost the soldiers, they establish memorials, so that Time do not heal. Please understand, many of the memorials, war memorials are created for the purpose that Time should not heal us. Only if you are not healed, you will carry that vengeance, anger continuously.  But Time is such a powerful healer, he even destroys the memorials.  He even destroys the memorials.  I know for sure, I can tell you from my own authority, after the Mahabharata War, Pandavas have built a memorial.  Now neither memory is there nor memorial is there.\n\nAnyhow, understand, guilt is a memorial you build not to forget some of the happenings, not to allow healing of some of the happenings in your life. But, I tell you, Kaala, Time is such a powerful healer, he can heal anything. He can just heal anything in life. He is such a powerful healer, healer, one of the greatest healer.\n\nSo, practice Integrity to complete with Kalabhairava. Practice Integrity to complete with Kalabhairava. Try.  Try this.   Respect your watch as God, embodiment of Kaala, means, Kaalabhairava's vigraha and decide, next ten days you will declare and maintain the Integrity with Time, so that you are complete with Kaala.  Then request him to heal your past incompletions. I tell you, he can just roll the past and put his healing hand and the whole thing will be healed. I tell you, any wound it may be, just Kalabhairava's one touch you will be healed. That is why we always say 'Time heals'. Kaala can heal anything. Kaala really can heal.\n\nPlease understand, practice Integrity to be complete with Time, not for the petty reasons of just acceptance from society or small things.

These four are the essence of all religions, spiritual groups, philosophies, sects, cultures, the essence of psychology, these four principles are THE teachings: Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility, Enriching.\n\nToday, I'll expand how the fourth principle, 'Enriching' can empower you in the zone of relationships. If you are feeling powerless in your relationships, be very clear you will be powerless with the relationship with yourself. Relationship with yourself and relationship with others, both happen from the same space. In the relationship with others if you are feeling powerless, you will have the same powerlessness in the relationship with you. Relationship with you, if you are feeling powerful, complete, relationship with others, you will feel same powerful, completeness.\n\nDhyan se suniye, ye char tatva jo hai, ve keval mere sikshan nahin hain, ye char tatva poore shastra evam dharma ka saransha hain.\n\nThey are not just my teaching, these four principles are THE teachings. Any human being has to listen, learn these four, the moment he's born, the moment he starts living, during living and before death.\n\nYe char tatva sabhi dharmo, aadhyatmic samoohon, darshan, sampradayon, mano vignyaan, sabhi ka saar hai.\n\nToday I'll expand on the fourth principle: « ENRICHING » how this principle is going to heal your relationship with you and your relationship with others, make you feel powerful with regards to relationship with others and relationship with you. Enriching, the principle of enriching, how it can be used to make yourself powerful in the zone of relationship with you and relationship with others.\n\nDhyan se suniye, listen to the definition of enriching once again. Enriching is, you taking responsibility with Integrity and Authenticity that you are committed to continuously enriching, which is expanding yourself, and life in and around you.\n\nLabhanvit karne ki paribhasha, punah suniye, aapyayanam ya labhanvit karne ka arth hai, aap\n\nSampoorti evam Shraddha ke saat zamedari uthaye ki aap lagatar aapyayanam ya\n\nswayam ko aur aapke andar aur bahar ko jeevan ke lagatar labhanvit karnekeliye pratibadh ho.\n\nFirst I'll expand what is your relationship with yourself. Please understand, just look in, the ideas you carry about you, how many of you suffer a deep distrust over you, you cannot raise yourself to the higher level, very deeply inside you, cognize and raise your hands. Why, relax, why? Understand, because, you are not consistently, continuoulsy enriching yourself and raising yourself to the next level. You gave up on you, you gave up on yourself. The relationship with you, by you lacks enriching. I tell you, if you don't teach yourself continuosly these four principles of Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching, not only you will give up on you, you will give up on others also. People who give up on themselves are very  dangerous, because when you feel, 'anyhow you are going to be doomed, then what is there? after all I'm going to be doomed, if I do this also what is the wrong? if I do that also what is the wrong?' There is no limit for your falling, you will see consciously you are having a freefall, like Indian stock market. Just freefall. No, a few months before, the way the rupee was falling, you can't use that paper for anything. That is the speed with which the freefall was happening. I tell you, listen, the moment you give up on yourslf you give up on others, and you are dangerous to you and to the society.\n\nAap lagatar apne aapko labhanvit nahin karte hain, apne aap  ko lagatar samrudh nahin karte hai, kyon ki apne aap par se vishwaas khochuke hai. Suniye, Aap par se vishwas kochuke hai.\n\nLord Sri Krishna again and again says, « Uddhared aatmana aatmanam na aatmaanam avasadayet »","slug":"do-you-love-yourself-su57ome8agc","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Su57Ome8Agc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAcTABUDJ4D8Vi4Q_rfntwHVThwyw","youtubeID":"Su57Ome8Agc"}}]}}},{"id":"6","attributes":{"title":"Guided Meditations","slug":"guided-meditations","description":"","videos":{"data":[{"id":"368","attributes":{"title":"Third Eye Meditation: Most Ancient, Authentic and Powerful Meditation Guided by Nithyananda","description":"Nithyananda explains the origin of this technique is the Shiva Agamas, the oldest, most detailed, spiritual scriptures available to mankind, revealed by Mahadeva himself.

He explained that Living Advaitha is possible by living in perpetual completion. In Nithya Dhyan all the best methodologies are used to awaken the non-mechanical parts of the brain which put you into a state of restful awareness or being sure about you. When you are permanently sure about you this is perpetual completion or living Advaitha.\n\nThe Technique\nLife Bliss Meditation is the meditation process which creates perpetual Completion in your system.  I will give you a few minutes; please settle down and adjust yourself, make yourself comfortable.  Then I will lead you step by step.\n \nYes!  The first step, please understand, the first step of the process is \"CHAOTIC BREATHING\".  Means, awakening and raising the prana, life energy level in your body to its peak possibility.  It is a most dynamic aspect.  You can put your hand on the hip and start breathing as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible.  It is like hyperventilating; that's all; nothing else; hyperventilating you.  Use your whole body to breathe. \n \nThe first step is just seven minutes.  If you want, you can sit on your heels with knees and feet together in Vajrasan, or you can sit comfortably; but use your whole body and breathe!  Use your whole body and breathe!  I can demonstrate by myself.  See here (Swamiji demonstrates).  Use your whole body and breathe as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible, but as comfortably as possible.  Let your whole body become alive!  Let the hyperventilation happen in you.  Please be sincere as much as you can.  Do it as long as you are comfortable.  If you have high blood-pressure, do it mildly, comfortably.  Others do it sincerely, authentically.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n \nNow move to the next step: \"INTENSE HUMMING\".  Sit in the same way.  Either sit on your knees or sit comfortably.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole awareness be on the humming sound.  It is almost like if you put your mouth into an empty vessel and create a vibration how it will be, same way.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole body vibrate with that humming sound: MMMMmmmmmmmmmm.....!!!  Hum as sincerely as possible, as intensely as possible.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Do it as sincerely as possible, as loudly as possibly, as deeply as possible.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n\nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the Root Chakra (Muladhara) at the base of your spine.  \nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the spleen area (Swadishtana Chakra).\nSee yourself in your navel centre as a powerful light (Manipura Chakra).\nNow bring your awareness to the Heart Centre, centre of the heart (Anahata Chakra).  Visualize yourself as a powerful light.\nNow bring your awareness to the Throat Centre, Vishuddhi Chakra.\nNow bring your awareness to the Third Eye between both the eyes, Ajna Chakra.  See yourself as a powerful light on the Third Eye.\nBring your awareness to the Crown Centre, the top of your head, the Sahasrara Chakra.  See yourself as a light on the Crown Centre.\n \nWith my Integrity and Authenticity, I bless you all!  Let you all experience Kundalini awakening!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!\n \nNow just relax.  Sit in the space of \"UNCLUTCHED\".  Decide to yourself you will sit in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any incompletion that comes up, complete and drop them.  Be in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any doubt, fear, powerlessness comes up in you, unclutch.\n \n(After some minutes)\n \nI bless you all and initiate all of you.  Let your Kundalini Shakthi be intensely awakened!  Let your brain mirror the neuron activities of an incarnation, the peak possibility!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!\n \nI bless you all!  Let you all experience the Complete Completion with yourself and others!  Let you all be the space of perpetual Completion!  Let you all be the space of perpetual possibility!  Let you all be the space of perpetual living enlightenment!  Let you all be the space of perpetual living Advaitha!\n \nI request every one of you, please practice this Life Bliss Meditation every day.\n\nThis video provides links to the following video's:\nThird Eye Awakening by Nithyananda\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na24g0vqx0A\nAnanda Gandha Chakra Source of Super Conscious Healing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqX7zgAqLxs\nWhy Vegetarianism? - Nithyananda\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysr2PhnZi7w","slug":"life-bliss-meditation-nithya-dhyaan-the-meditation-process-ynyoous1of8","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YnYOOUs1oF8/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"YnYOOUs1oF8"}},{"id":"370","attributes":{"title":"Guided Meditation for Activating Powers","description":"In this guided meditation, taken from the session for Manifesting Powers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v85CT_lBXSc), Paramahamsa Nithyananda presents a unique practice from the Agamas, 'the skeleton dance', to build integrity in the bone structure. Till now, the teachings on integrity were to practice integrity as a mental technique. But integrity is is a bio-memory stored in your bone structure, and in this video Paramahamsa Nithyananda gives integrity as a physical practice. Building integrity from the physical level is very powerful and fast, working from the inside out and pushing and manifesting in all aspects of life.\n\nIn the introduction to the technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda also explains why we need integrity. With the power of integrity, everything we say becomes reality, even if it is not in line with the laws of physics and nature. Integrity itself is an important spiritual power, the power of words. And, our integrity is essential for receiving the initiations of the Master when he guides us into manifesting more and more powers. Since it is only through our integrity that the Master addresses us.\n\nWhen introducing the technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda gives this explanation: 'You will visualise your skeleton structure. Without loosing power over your skeleton structure, you go on jumping, dancing for any song. Your body should be active, as many bones as possible should be moving, but your inner space should be holding the whole skeleton structure’s visualisation. It will almost be like a skeleton dancing. You will see in your inner space the skeleton dancing, but that cannot reduce the speed of your dance. Your movement should be there and the skeleton structure should be held in your inner space.'","slug":"guided-meditation-for-activating-powers-b9htja9ksmu","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/b9htjA9kSMU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"b9htjA9kSMU"}},{"id":"371","attributes":{"title":"Trinetra Kumbhaka - Breathing Technique to Attain the State, Space, & Powers of Mahadeva","description":"In this video (23 April 2018), Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains the Trinetra Kumbhaka breathing technique, as revealed by Mahadeva - Sadashiva.

International Day of Yoga 2017 Message","description":"Unpublished on 22/09/2019 by Parashiva, Shivarupa\n\nIn conjunction with International Yoga Day, His Holiness Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda Swamiji set a unique first ever world record: 108 of his initiated disciples demonstrated the power of Third Eye Awakening. With physical eyes closed and blindfolded, each one passed three strictly monitored tests, reading whatever was written for them and accurately reproducing drawings made for them to trace. 108 dignitaries came from around the world as an ethics committee to ensure the tests were performed in accordance with strict scientific criteria. These guests included doctors, school administrators, artists, publishers, heads of state, leaders of religious organizations and more. Among them, Sri Vedantam ji, founder and chairman of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Mr. Prasad, State President of BJP, Dr. Raju, Research Director of NIMHANS, Mallikarjun, Principal of BMS engineering college and Manjunath, Leader of Bajrang Sene, showed great enthusiasm for the powers displayed.\n\nOur invited guests were joined by Ms. Komal Singh, an executive from India Book of Records, who had the honour and privilege to adjudicate the authenticity of one of the Powers of Third Eye Awakening which is blindfold reading. Over a hundred initiated balasanths of the Nithyananda Gurukul demonstrated this power in one sitting with all esteemed guests evaluating their unprecedented abilities. Never before on planet earth, in modern history or even in the sacred Puranas, has such a large group of people simultaneously demonstrated these great powers. The excitement in the room was high, as child after child wowed their judges with quick, detailed and completely accurate performance.\n\nIn the Sri Gurugita, Sadashiva reveals that Guru is atrinetraḥ śivaḥ sākṣāt|, which means, Guru is directly Śiva Himself without the visible three eyes. His third eye may not be visible while in human embdiment, but it’s only the Guru, Sadashiva, with his third eye open, who can initiate others into opening theirs.\n\nNithyananda says, “In Hindu tradition, powers are extraordinary but not unnatural. Extraordinary but not impossible.”  About the Gurukul students who are effortlessly demonstrating these extraordinary powers, He proclaimed, “These kids will bring spiritual legitimacy to Sanatana Hindu Dharma,” to which the hall erupted in applause.\n\nMs. Kamal Singh was so impressed by the display that she honoured the Balasanths of Nithyananda Gurukul on the spot, with a certificate stating that they undeniably proved the power of the Third Eye in an unprecedented display, and proclaimed that although she attended the event as a representative from India Book of Records, surely this will be featured in Asia Book of Records, as well.\n\nFollowing the mass demonstration, His Holiness Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda Swamiji addressed the crowd with a special satsangh discourse in celebration of World Yoga Day. \n\nOne highlight of the evening was the release of the ultimate sourcebook on yoga, “Nithyananda Yoga: Evolution of New Species.” \n\nFor the first time, the ultimate authority on Yoga is being presented with scriptural evidences of Yoga, the Shaastra Pramanas - from the Vedaagamas; with a fourfold level of authentification called Pramanas. These Pramanas include Shastra Pramana, the ancient scriptural references in the Vedas and Agamas; Apta Pramana, the commentary on these verses by Rishis and Munis who experienced; Atma Pramana, the experience of the Avatar Nithyananda Himself, and Sakshi Pramana, the experience given by Nithyananda to all of His initiated disciples. Only when a science is found in the ancient scripture, verified through enlightened commentary, experienced by Nithyananda and demonstrably transferred to his disciples, it is included in Nithyananda Yoga and Nithyananda Mahayoga. The fully illustrated comprehensive book includes sections from Yoga scriptures on over 200 + Asanas, 350+ Pranayama, Kumbhakas, Mudras, Bandhas, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, Mantras, Yogic physiology and the Yogic Lifestyle, Yogic Diet, Yogic purification techniques, and more. \n\n“This book makes a strong statement,” says Nithyananda, “Yoga has a religion; that religion is Hinduism!” \n\nIn keeping with the sacred Vedagamic tradition, this beautiful book is offered to humanity as a free gift from Nithyananda, who says, 'Anyone who is practicing yoga or teaching yoga, if you want this book for yourself and your students, please send an email to oohh@nithyananda.org with required details and the hard copy will be sent to you, free of cost.'

With all my respect to Patanjali, at least 50.000 years before Patanjali, a being walked on the earth assuming the human form, just like all of us, Adi Guru Sada Shiva, is the founder of the original yoga system. There is enough detailed description, including yoga postures and breathing methods, written directly by Sada Shiva.\nKnowing the original source and original author is very important for keeping the purity of a tradition or knowledge branch. Knowing the originator, founding father, his intentions, revelations, knowledge about that is too important. Any knowledge branch will be only complete if intentions of author are revealed to the person studying.\nSecond, which you have never been told, which you need to be aware. Always, as per original source, any practice you are asked to do …, original sources are available. Please understand, people who try to establish themselves as a branch of yoga have messed up yoga. What is going on with yoga? Understand, it can be used along with Pilates, sports, body building no problem. But it can not be diluted.\nPlease understand. One of the important truth: yoga cannot be separated from Hinduism. It cannot be separated! Dilution is sampradaya droha, understand!\nPeople ask me: who is an authentic yoga teacher? I am clearing all doubts: all yoga practices are described with tremendous detail, accuracy, by Sada Shiva. You do not need anyone else to develop any of the yogic techniques and methods. Do not believe if someone says they developed from yoga – he only diluted. Nobody can develop Sada Shiva! He is complete for the past, present and future. He has seen all the possible bodies happened, happen, yet to happen.\nNew kind of bodies are about to happen. Subtle brain grooves, more understanding. These new bodies are coming. Sada Shiva has created yoga even for the bodies which are about to come in the future. He knows the whole.\nNo one can develop on Sada Shiva!\nYou need to know very clearly, there are 3 kind of people teaching yoga: 1) who are claiming to teach from their personal experience. 2) who knows only the scriptures, does not have personal experience – pandits, scholars. Create less problems than those so called enlightened guru’s who do not abide by the scriptures are more dangerous for humanity than the people who are just abiding by the scriptures without enlightenment. Because they will never damage you. The so called enlightened beings, because they get your trust and authority. Feeling little more peace does not mean you have become enlightened! These so called enlightened masters are more dangerous than just the pandits, parrots who repeat from scripture directly. So called enlightened masters who don’t abide by original yogic literatures – they get one or two glimpse, because of that they receive authority and all their whims and fancies, you also follow! Very rare third category 3) who have a very solid enlightenment experience, who are authorities, responsible for what they are speaking, and also completely rooted, centered on yogic scriptures. Those are the rare beings from which you should be learning. Personal experience should always be in tune with experience of Rishi’s. A real Guru will have both and present both. Otherwise, if somebody says I only have my experience – please understand, don’t become prey to their advertising and immature ego. Atma Pramana, only when it is in tune with Apta Pramana, then it can be shared with the world as Sakshi Pramana.  People who have personal experience – it may be good for them, but it may not be good for all of you.\n\nThird important truth you need to know have never been told. Yoga is not just the science of keeping you healthy. Yoga is the science of radiating enlightenment. It is not just for ability to stretch your body. Ability to manifestwhat you want. Not about making you better man, but about making you superman! Radiate powers immediately. Please understand, do not have patience with your practice. You have been given wrong instruction! No! If you have been asked to wait, you have been cheated. Yoga is a powerful alchemy system, gives result immediately as you start. Otherwise you are being cheated, that is not yoga. Quality of yoga is, even if it is practiced little, brings tremendous result immediately, day 1. By month 1 should manifest powers. If not, question teacher and system which has been given to you.","slug":"yoga-webinar-2016-what-you-need-to-know-about-yoga-zmr9sdqrlva","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zmr9SDqRlvA/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"zmr9SDqRlvA"}},{"id":"1669","attributes":{"title":"Do not have patience with your yoga practice","description":"This is a short video by Paramahamsa Nithyananda, taken from the Yoga Webinar 2016 (http://bit.ly/28VLnXq).

Yoga is much more than just the physical postures, the asanas, and its goal is much more than just our health and well-being. Through yoga, our body, mind, and our breathing reach their peak potential, ultimately to awaken our Kundalini Shakti. Once that is awakened, extraordinary abilities and powers open up in us. This makes yoga one of the greatest gifts Mahadeva has given to the world!\n\n\nTranscript:\n\nLet me explain yoga. Adi Yogi Mahadeva revealed this science in the Shiva Agamas to the whole universe, as a science to awaken your inner potential energy. I don’t want to say the physical postures are not yoga, and I don’t want to say physical health is not purpose of yoga - that is also included. \n\nPlease understand, there is so much of confusion. As usual, anything practices by billions will have variations, confusions, debates - it is usual. Whether the physical postures are yoga. Please understand: physical postures are also yoga. It is not that they are not part of yoga, and I also do not want to say they are alone as yoga, no. Physical postures are not excluded, but that does not mean only physical postures are yoga. \n\nIt is a great science, where your body is trained to acchieve its peak potential through asanas. And mind is trained through liberated thinking. Your breathing structure is trained through pranayama. The various steps are used in yoga, ultimately, to awaken your kundalini shakti. Yoga is not meant just for your well being or health, it is meant to awaken your mystical powers. It is meant to awaken your spiritual realisation. Realising your spiritual identity is the ultimate goal of yoga. Kundalini is the inner potential energy. Once it is awakened, you will experience extraordinary health, physically, mentally, and extraordinary powers, abilities. Everything in yoga is finally aimed at: it can be as simple as washing your eyes. Or as difficult as Sirsasana or NIthya Douthi Kriyas. Everything is aimed at awakening the Kundalini Shakti in you. To awaken the extraordinary possibilities, and abilities in you. \n\nYoga is one of the greatest gift given to the world given by Mahadeva directly. Please understand, yoga is organised by Patanjali, but gifted by Mahadeva himself.","slug":"what-is-the-purpose-of-yoga-yb4zg7srfk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/yb4z_g7Srfk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"yb4z_g7Srfk"}}]}}},{"id":"38","attributes":{"title":"Popular Videos","slug":"popular-videos","description":"Popular and trending videos on KAILASA's Nithyananda TV","videos":{"data":[{"id":"2368","attributes":{"title":"3-Step Technique to Heal & Complete Your Relationships","description":"In this video (14 May 2015), Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals a 3-step technique to heal and complete all our relationships: the completion process.","slug":"3-step-technique-to-heal-and-complete-your-relationships-pets9notwou","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEtS9NoTwOU/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"PEtS9NoTwOU"}},{"id":"2369","attributes":{"title":"Shivoham Process - Purifying Sounds & Visualizations in the Mind & Body","description":"In this video (14 May 2015), Paramahamsa Nithyananda introduces the Shivoham process in which disciples sit around the Guru in the shape of sacred geometric shapes called Mandalas.

Paramahamsa Nithyananda says it is time for the Akhadas to wake up to the truth. Born Hindu's should become practicing Hindu's. Swamiji boldly says that when you bend your body for Surya Namaskar, you are a practicing Hindu.\nMr Malhotra asks Swamiji about expressing powers, tells that many people think that Siddhi's will distract you from your path to enlightenment. Swamiji explains how the tradition and structure of Patanajali's teachings is different form Sadashiva's tradition. The Siddhis Patanjali speaks about are not the same as the Shaktis that Sadashiva speaks about. Shaktis, as Sadashiva calls the powers are only expressed from the oneness, never on the path to oneness. Powers expressed from the space of oneness, rooted in oneness, can never lead you astray, they will only establish that state of oneness more and more. Swamiji encourages all his disciples and devotees to express powers and invites everyone who is curious to come and experience them.","slug":"ask-the-avatar-rajiv-malhotra-tvsu9xb93so","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Tvsu9Xb93So/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"Tvsu9Xb93So"}},{"id":"6","attributes":{"title":"Ask The Avatar - Celebrate Gurubhakti Through Sanyas","description":"","slug":"ask-the-avatar-celebrate-gurubhakti-through-sanyas-1vavrwxhv8k","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1VAvrWxHV8k/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"1VAvrWxHV8k"}},{"id":"7","attributes":{"title":"Ask The Avatar - Rapid Fire Q&A","description":"In this video (10 November 2017), Paramahamsa Nithyananda answers a flurry of rapid fire questions on Facebook Live.","slug":"ask-the-avatar-rapid-fire-qanda-ufhtma15m","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/UFhtMA_1_5M/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"UFhtMA_1_5M"}},{"id":"8","attributes":{"title":"How to Become Intelligent?","description":"In this Q&A session (8 November 2017), Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals what is true intelligence and how to become intelligent.","slug":"how-to-become-intelligent-wtjz9j04aw0","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wTJZ9j04AW0/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"wTJZ9j04AW0"}},{"id":"9","attributes":{"title":"Ask The Avatar - The Avatar's Ultimate Quality, Cosmic Play, 11 Genders, Dimensions of the Universe","description":"","slug":"ask-the-avatar-the-avatars-ultimate-quality-cosmic-play-11-genders-dimensions-of-the-universe-ftaaevacrwc","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/FtaAEvACRwc/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"FtaAEvACRwc"}},{"id":"10","attributes":{"title":"Ask The Avatar - Modern to Traditional Medicine, Vedic Technology","description":"In this video (7th Oct, 2017), from the Ask The Avatar series, Paramahamsa Nithyananda answers questions on moving from modern to traditional forms of medicine and the revival of ancient Vedic technologies.","slug":"ask-the-avatar-modern-to-traditional-medicine-vedic-technology-ewtfa8llk","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eWTfA_8l_lk/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"eWTfA_8l_lk"}},{"id":"11","attributes":{"title":"Does Nithyananda have favourites or sees everyone as equal?","description":"In this Q&A session (8 November 2017), Paramahamsa Nithyananda answers the question - whether he has favourites or sees all His disciples as the same.","slug":"does-nithyananda-have-favourites-or-sees-everyone-as-equal-8gxnenanv4","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8gxnEnanV_4/maxresdefault.webp","youtubeID":"8gxnEnanV_4"}}]}}},{"id":"3","attributes":{"title":"Bhagavad Gita","slug":"bhagavad-gita","description":"","videos":{"data":[{"id":"27","attributes":{"title":"Celibacy, Key to Superhuman Powers","description":"TALKS FROM MORNING SATSANG ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2012 IN TIRUVANNAMALAI, INDIA\n\nBhagavad Gita (Song of God) is a timeless treatise on the essence of living enlightenment.

The fundamental practice of Upanishad, in which devotees sit in the presence of a Master and integrate the principles of meditation, is no longer transmitted as a central religious element among Hindus. Ideally, children learn this practice from their parents at an early age and carry the reverence they acquire into adulthood. Nithyananda points out that while non-Hindus are often forbidden to worship in Hindu temples, Hindus themselves may not be worshipping with the right spiritual understanding. He recommends that Hindus return to the Vedic roots of their spirituality.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nIt is so unfortunate that whole Hinduism lost this Upanishad.   Buddhism is still able to create more and more enlightened beings just because they held on to that one truth \"Zazen\".  Zazen means just sitting.  It is so unfortunate even the priests in the South Indian Temples are standing and doing Pooja.  So this idea of sitting is completely lost.  Above the Mahakal, if you see all temples will be sitting and doing Pooja.  Below Mahakal, all will be standing and doing Pooja.  It is unfortunate.  You may think \"What is there in sitting\".  You don't know.  I tell you. You don't know -- power of sitting.  By sitting, sitting, you will learn how to be sitting with aloneness \"Rahasistitaha, Aatmanam rahasistitaha\".  That is why, in Hindu tradition, the highest practice is called Upanishad. The highest preaching is called Upanishad.  Even the place where the teaching is transmitted is called seat.  Peeta.  Understand.  So much of importance was given to sitting.   I tell you.  If you learn sitting, sitting, sitting, you will easily pick-up this sitting with yourself. The Upanishad. \n\nIf I have my own way, I will really tell all our Ashrams and centers, have furniture  and chairs only for the people who cannot sit on the floor. Elders or who are sick or handicapped. \n\nEven to all our devotees, I give this as a spiritual instruction.  Only when you are not feeling well, when you can't sit on the floor, use furniture.   Otherwise even in the house have furniture for the visitors.  But when you all guys sit, all you guys sit on the floor.  You don't know, this habit of sitting on the floor will slowly help you to sit with yourself.  Upanishad.\n\nSo in 11 days you can catch that Upanishad samyama.  In Buddhism they have a very beautiful way. They will just gaze at the wall, facing the wall they will sit and gaze. No thoughts allowed.  Just sit. \n\nBodhi dharma sat in Upanishad for 12 years gazing the wall.  Now after all, all you guys, Niraharis, you may need to move your head away from the wall may be 3 times a day for juice. \n\nI really wanted Hinduism to get back to that truth of Upanishad.\n\nIt is so sad when I went to Nepal this time, in Katmandu I saw 82 percent Hindu population, only 5 percent budhist population but go in any street, you will find 10 buddhist monks going around.  You will not find a single Hindu monk.  It is so sad.  You guys lost all the spiritual wealth, you inherited.  Why do you think your next generation is not becoming monks. Because it was never based on the spiritual inspiration.  You can see those Buddhist monks highly educated, cultured working on the spiritual truths. The few hindu monks you will see that's also very few. One or two.  Old beggars.  In Katmandu, Pasupathinath temple asking for few penny. That's it. I take a vow in the name of Maha Kala and Maha Kali. Just through the akashic readings, inspiring and initiating I will create atleast 100 thousand sadhus, sanyasis. I mean youngsters, celibates living enlightenment and spreading enlightenment. Giving life to the vedic tradition.  It is really unfortunate that these great spiritual heritage.  In Zen monasteries, Buddhist monasteries, you can see thousands of monks sitting in Zazen for a whole day. \n\nHats off to ISKON movement for making ajapa japa as a life style. They atleast brought that back. \n\nBut one of the greatest heritage of Hinduism, vedic tradition the Upanishad.  Neither gurus talk about it nor disciples practice. The general public do not even have confidence that Upanishad is possible in their life.    In Hindiusm if you are a monk, you can't even survive unless you do some social service.  I am not against social service. Just now I blessed the people who gave the money.  I am going to send this and going to do social service.  But that should not replace our mystical explorations.  Unfortunately, in Hinduism the mystical exploring has been replaced by running schools, colleges and hospitals. \n\nEach person inspired about enlightenment is a diamond.  His time and energy should be directed towards achieving the enlightenment and radiating the extraordinary experiences and powers of enlightenment.","slug":"what-is-missing-in-hinduism-9y3xxeebjlm","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y3xXEEBjLM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDxOAt96NvqYh_0EZ-6Ym_WBvlQkw","youtubeID":"9y3xXEEBjLM"}},{"id":"35","attributes":{"title":"Upanishad Sammyama - Technique for Self-Discovery","description":"Bhagavad Gita (Song of God) is a timeless treatise on the essence of living enlightenment.

This beautiful practice of sitting with the Master is the cornerstone of Vedic spirituality. NIthyananda gives a meditation technique to experience its essence. When we sit to meditate, our thoughts are often cluttered with distractions. Nithyananda advises us to sit with intentional focus on our distractions so that we purify them.

I feel so joyful to talk on these verses because these verses are the exact path I walked. Understand it is like a once you become enlightened you know all the paths.  You can teach all the paths.  All the knowledge about all the paths are revealed to you, available to you.    But you always have a special affiliation to the path in which you travelled. \n \nI am so happy to teach these verses, because these are the verses, I will sit and read may be 12 or 13 even after my enlightenment.  Because the enlightenment happened in me as an experience.  I myself wanted to know what all the steps I walked through to achieve that experience.  So, like an explosion it has happened.  So now I needed to know without my knowledge what all the steps I walked through.  I never read this verse  atmaanam rahasisthitaha means seated within oneself in aloneness.  But I always used to practice this.  I always sit with Arunachala with the hill. This is the usual posture.  Not for 10 minutes, half-an-hour. Please don't mistake.  From sunrise to sunset.  Without feeling like getting up.  Not that I will have a thought. Oh let me get up and then I will try to control myself. No.  Just sitting and gazing.  The greatest blessing I  received from my mind and my body is only initial convincing I need to do. That's all.  After that never ever it disturbs.  This Nirahara Samyama.  Very casual like a sports .  Very sportively I started.  Only 1st day I need to convince.  By the time evening kala Bairava Dharshan, the body was ready.

If you feel, but you also feel, \"Ah, I may feel but I am not going to eat.  I am going to live\",  then your bio-memory is friend for you. \n \nBut if you feel \"No, no, these are all not for me.  I think I have already done too much. This 21 day itself is too much. Ah.  It's Ok, Ok\", then your bio-memory is your enemy. \n \nSee, actually you feeling \"this 21 days is too much for me\" all these is just your own decision about yourself.

Amazingly, the spiritual wisdom and life solutions offered in the Gita are so universal and current that even today it is used as a personal transformation guide. In today's talk on Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 9, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) reveals the layers of collective consciousness and how the world reflects them. Humans have potential to create three kinds of lifestyle, depending on their level of awareness. When society is dominated by the collective subconscious, it creates a money-chasing lifestyle ruled by greed. When collective unconscious has control over society, it evolves a lifestyle based on power and ruled by fear. Once we become aware of our greed and fear, and release them, we transform to a freedom-based system of independent thinking and individual responsibility.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nBhagavad Gita -- 6th chapter, DhyanaYoga, 9th verse\n\n \nSuhrun-mitraar-yudaaseena madhyastha-dveshya-bandhushu l\n\nSaadhush-vapi cha paapeshu samabuddhir-vishishyate ll\n\n \nThe Translation:\n\nThe one who feels the same towards an affectionate person, a friend and enemy, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful one, the unfriendly, the noble one or a sinner is said to be established in a superior state.\n\nUnderstand these few basic sacred secrets. Meditation is not an action. It is a lifestyle. That is why in the chapter on Meditation, Bhagvan is talking about all these things. You can never start meditating, you can only become meditative. Understand, there is a vast difference between starting meditation or becoming meditative. Meditation is not a Anacin, Metacin, Antidepressant. No! Meditation is not Anacin, Metacin, Antidepressant. Please understand, meditation cannot be just repairing something in you. It has to completely transform you.\n\nMeditating is different; being meditative is different. In this verse Bhagavan is very clear; your whole life should become meditative. The whole life should become meditative. Yesterday he was addressing objects, yesterday Bhagavan was saying, explaining in the last verse, how not to be disturbed by objects.\n\nNow Bhagavan is going to the next step, how not to be disturbed by the persons. Actually the seventh, eighth, ninth verses of Bhagavad Gita, these three verses can become a powerful samyama. First he has given us the technique to work with cold, heat, unpleasant, pleasant situations. Then he took us to the next level working with the fear-based mental setup and greed-based mental setup where you are free from the concept of greed. Now he is taking us to the next level, where he is making us free from the concept of higher, lower human beings. First he liberates us from atmosphere, weather, outer/inner. Outer is heat and cold. Inner is pleasant, unpleasant. Then he liberates us from the greed, objects.\n\nSama loshtashma kanchanah -- where you are free from cold; time and/or mud or a stone. He is making us free from the greed based patterns, greed. Now he is liberating us from human beings, sufferings that can be caused by human beings.\n\nHow when you drink more and more honey, only then you understand and enjoy it, same way only I am enjoying this Bhagavad Gita. Understand, through this verse, Bhagavan is liberating us from fear-based system. Yesterday itself I spoke on fear-based, greed-based, both the systems. But yesterday's verse, Bhagavan's Bhagavad Gita verse was talking only about the greed.  Sama loshtashma kanchanah. He was only talking about having impartiality between mud, stone or Gold.\n\nToday he talks about the power-based system, human beings, power-based systems. Please understand, power-based system is a product of human unconsciousness, greed-based system is a product of human sub-consciousness. Understand, power-based system is product of collective human un-consciousness; greed-based system is product of collective human sub-consciousness. You may ask 'what is the difference?' Unconscious means completely, the parts of which you are not unaware ( should be 'aware' ? ) but you try to make it aware, without awakening that unconscious into the super-conscious.\n\nEverybody has the feeling to become Lord of the Universe. You can become if you make your unconscious into conscious and super-conscious. When you make your unconscious into conscious, you will become Lord of you. When you raise that to super-conscious, you will be the Lord of whatever is in your space. More than the word Lord, I will use, you be in tune with the whole. This is the right way of becoming Lord of the Universe. But instead you try to become  a power center through political power.

The story demonstrated how Shiva saved not only humanity because they surrendered to him, but he saved them from themselves.\n\n\"Understand this story when the Guru assumes the human body, when he comes down to the human frequency, to save humanity from atheistic intellectuals and save spiritual power. In this whole story Shiva did not fight even once, he was in silence, all he did is whatever weapons were sent, he used them for himself, fire as heater, Damaru as playing, tiger skin as dress, elephant skin as blanket.

Shiva has taken human body in every one of you. He's there in you as Dakshinamurthy in the banyan tree of Ananda Gandha radiating the intense silence and energy. Whenever life throws things on you, all you need to do is relax into his space and it disappears, the whole thing will be turned from negativity to positivity. All the problems thrown to you will become glory for you.\"\n\n\"Now I want to gift you all one of the greatest gifts: eN-Meditation or eN-Dhyan.

Auspiciousness without reason or cause. When something exists without cause or reason, it's eternal. Even if you look at the extraordinary qualities of Mahadeva, when he sits in silence he puts people into enlightenment. Under the banyan tree, Dakshinamurty; when he dances, he puts people into bliss. Nataraja; when he destroys, he destroys all negativity. Kala Bairava; when he decides to show compassion, he can take any poison and swallow, no limit. When he decides to destroy, he will destroy even death, Yama. When he decides to save, he will go to any extent to save others, how he swallowed the poison to save the world, risking himself, his own body.\"\n\"The grandeur with which he expresses the experience, he showers on people who even remember him, Sadhashiva, the ultimate Guru , ultimate Yogi, ultimate King, Eeshwara, ultimate Leader, ultimate Bliss, ultimate compassion, ultimate life. With all these qualities, he is not too far away, very easy to approach, easily pleased. Nothing much is required to please him. That is why he's called Bole Baba, easily pleased.\"\n\n\"Today is the celebration of Shiva appearing as an eternal light shaft as Arunachala. Today is the day intense cosmic energy radiates. He enters the physical plane as a master, in the body, for people to experience all the auspicious qualities experienced as life and not just as a belief. He is the charmer of the Kundalini snake. He can play with the Kundalini snake which resides in every being.\"\n\n\"Today is the day we are supposed to constantly dive into the qualities of Mahadeva. Shiva is filled with Ananda kalyana guna, thousands and thousands of auspicious qualities, so I'm picking up 7 qualities for you to contemplate on:\n1. Fantasy less being\n2. Being beyond fear\n3. Being without worries\n4. Sharing giving always giving\n5. A being who's unique\n6. So simple and easily available\n7. Being in eternal fulfillment , Nithyananda\"\nNithyananda encouraged us all to dedicate this day towards our inner self. No outer world work, the whole day, only contemplate on these 7 qualities. Go on repeating the Mahamantra, the great mantra, the sacred sound, \"Om Nama Shivaya.\"\n\nIn preparation for the Kundalini awakening in the evening, he gave these 3 instructions:\nFast, drinking only bale juice or coconut water, \nRemember the auspicious qualities of Mahadeva,\nAnd finally repeat the sacred sound Om Nama Shivaya, \n\n\"Today we observe another important thing, the day to destroy collective negativity.

Real peace is the explosion of the mind which asks for peace into pieces. What you ask for as peace is tamasic, chronic fatigue; you just want to jump into the cozy cave. You have to remember that your cave is inside my Himalayas.\"\n\n\"Samadhi happens to a person whose Non-mechanical part of the brain is awakened. The mind which asks for peace has to be blown away. A real master will never run a resort, only a commune. A person who asks for a resort will never be allowed in the presence of a Living Master.\"\n\n\"I am all for the extraordinary experiences and powers you go through during the samyama process but don't get down or stop there. Fulfillment happens in a space where there is no mind to be fulfilled. Enlightenment is continuous expansion. The experience goes on and on. There will be no board saying you have arrived. Enlightenment is not a destination, it's part of destiny.\"\n\n\"In Vedic Tradition, the fear of backing out because the seekers may back out was the reason why the concept of Enlightenment was not discussed in an elaborate way. Through the 108 Upanishad, nowhere is Enlightenment discussed. The point where you experience Enlightenment is a non-return zone.\"\n\n\"Knowing the other person's mind happens in you when you become more silent. Why are you running behind what the other is thinking when you don't even know what you are thinking?! If you relax and settle down in your mind, you will know what the others are thinking.\"\n\nThe 2 sacred sentiments in this sutra are - \n1. Knowing what happens in another person's mind is not everything.\n2. These kind of siddhis can be encouraged. When it happens, be aware. There are no 'you have arrived' boards in your inner journey, only non-return zones.\n\n\"So go on and on. Know clearly, only the point where you cannot remember the person who started this journey, you are enlightened. That is the space of Enlightenment. That is the space of Jivan Mukthi.\"","slug":"mind-of-spiritual-seeker-patanjali-yoga-sutras-127-nithyananda-message-1-mar-2011-88bsqxpanoa","thumbnailURL":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88BsqxPANOA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBLlFY8s9gs5M4ixKQT6i-OnovN9w","youtubeID":"88BsqxPANOA"}},{"id":"383","attributes":{"title":"Why we need a Guru?
