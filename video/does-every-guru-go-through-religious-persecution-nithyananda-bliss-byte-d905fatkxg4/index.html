With physical eyes closed and blindfolded, each one passed three strictly monitored tests, reading whatever was written for them and accurately reproducing drawings made for them to trace. 108 dignitaries came from around the world as an ethics committee to ensure the tests were performed in accordance with strict scientific criteria. These guests included doctors, school administrators, artists, publishers, heads of state, leaders of religious organizations and more. Among them, Sri Vedantam ji, founder and chairman of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Mr. Prasad, State President of BJP, Dr. Raju, Research Director of NIMHANS, Mallikarjun, Principal of BMS engineering college and Manjunath, Leader of Bajrang Sene, showed great enthusiasm for the powers displayed.\n\nOur invited guests were joined by Ms. Komal Singh, an executive from India Book of Records, who had the honour and privilege to adjudicate the authenticity of one of the Powers of Third Eye Awakening which is blindfold reading. Over a hundred initiated balasanths of the Nithyananda Gurukul demonstrated this power in one sitting with all esteemed guests evaluating their unprecedented abilities. Never before on planet earth, in modern history or even in the sacred Puranas, has such a large group of people simultaneously demonstrated these great powers. The excitement in the room was high, as child after child wowed their judges with quick, detailed and completely accurate performance.\n\nIn the Sri Gurugita, Sadashiva reveals that Guru is atrinetraḥ śivaḥ sākṣāt|, which means, Guru is directly Śiva Himself without the visible three eyes. His third eye may not be visible while in human embdiment, but it’s only the Guru, Sadashiva, with his third eye open, who can initiate others into opening theirs.\n\nNithyananda says, “In Hindu tradition, powers are extraordinary but not unnatural. Extraordinary but not impossible.”  About the Gurukul students who are effortlessly demonstrating these extraordinary powers, He proclaimed, “These kids will bring spiritual legitimacy to Sanatana Hindu Dharma,” to which the hall erupted in applause.\n\nMs. Kamal Singh was so impressed by the display that she honoured the Balasanths of Nithyananda Gurukul on the spot, with a certificate stating that they undeniably proved the power of the Third Eye in an unprecedented display, and proclaimed that although she attended the event as a representative from India Book of Records, surely this will be featured in Asia Book of Records, as well.\n\nFollowing the mass demonstration, His Holiness Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda Swamiji addressed the crowd with a special satsangh discourse in celebration of World Yoga Day. \n\nOne highlight of the evening was the release of the ultimate sourcebook on yoga, “Nithyananda Yoga: Evolution of New Species.” \n\nFor the first time, the ultimate authority on Yoga is being presented with scriptural evidences of Yoga, the Shaastra Pramanas - from the Vedaagamas; with a fourfold level of authentification called Pramanas. These Pramanas include Shastra Pramana, the ancient scriptural references in the Vedas and Agamas; Apta Pramana, the commentary on these verses by Rishis and Munis who experienced; Atma Pramana, the experience of the Avatar Nithyananda Himself, and Sakshi Pramana, the experience given by Nithyananda to all of His initiated disciples. Only when a science is found in the ancient scripture, verified through enlightened commentary, experienced by Nithyananda and demonstrably transferred to his disciples, it is included in Nithyananda Yoga and Nithyananda Mahayoga. The fully illustrated comprehensive book includes sections from Yoga scriptures on over 200 + Asanas, 350+ Pranayama, Kumbhakas, Mudras, Bandhas, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, Mantras, Yogic physiology and the Yogic Lifestyle, Yogic Diet, Yogic purification techniques, and more. \n\n“This book makes a strong statement,” says Nithyananda, “Yoga has a religion; that religion is Hinduism!” \n\nIn keeping with the sacred Vedagamic tradition, this beautiful book is offered to humanity as a free gift from Nithyananda, who says, 'Anyone who is practicing yoga or teaching yoga, if you want this book for yourself and your students, please send an email to oohh@nithyananda.org with required details and the hard copy will be sent to you, free of cost.'

Patanjali is the organizer, not originator. With all my respect to Patanjali, at least 50.000 years before Patanjali, a being walked on the earth assuming the human form, just like all of us, Adi Guru Sada Shiva, is the founder of the original yoga system. There is enough detailed description, including yoga postures and breathing methods, written directly by Sada Shiva.\nKnowing the original source and original author is very important for keeping the purity of a tradition or knowledge branch. Knowing the originator, founding father, his intentions, revelations, knowledge about that is too important. Any knowledge branch will be only complete if intentions of author are revealed to the person studying.\nSecond, which you have never been told, which you need to be aware. Always, as per original source, any practice you are asked to do …, original sources are available. Please understand, people who try to establish themselves as a branch of yoga have messed up yoga. What is going on with yoga? Understand, it can be used along with Pilates, sports, body building no problem. But it can not be diluted.\nPlease understand. One of the important truth: yoga cannot be separated from Hinduism. It cannot be separated! Dilution is sampradaya droha, understand!\nPeople ask me: who is an authentic yoga teacher? I am clearing all doubts: all yoga practices are described with tremendous detail, accuracy, by Sada Shiva. You do not need anyone else to develop any of the yogic techniques and methods. Do not believe if someone says they developed from yoga – he only diluted. Nobody can develop Sada Shiva! He is complete for the past, present and future. He has seen all the possible bodies happened, happen, yet to happen.\nNew kind of bodies are about to happen. Subtle brain grooves, more understanding. These new bodies are coming. Sada Shiva has created yoga even for the bodies which are about to come in the future. He knows the whole.\nNo one can develop on Sada Shiva!\nYou need to know very clearly, there are 3 kind of people teaching yoga: 1) who are claiming to teach from their personal experience. 2) who knows only the scriptures, does not have personal experience – pandits, scholars. Create less problems than those so called enlightened guru’s who do not abide by the scriptures are more dangerous for humanity than the people who are just abiding by the scriptures without enlightenment. Because they will never damage you. The so called enlightened beings, because they get your trust and authority. Feeling little more peace does not mean you have become enlightened! These so called enlightened masters are more dangerous than just the pandits, parrots who repeat from scripture directly. So called enlightened masters who don’t abide by original yogic literatures – they get one or two glimpse, because of that they receive authority and all their whims and fancies, you also follow! Very rare third category 3) who have a very solid enlightenment experience, who are authorities, responsible for what they are speaking, and also completely rooted, centered on yogic scriptures. Those are the rare beings from which you should be learning. Personal experience should always be in tune with experience of Rishi’s. A real Guru will have both and present both. Otherwise, if somebody says I only have my experience – please understand, don’t become prey to their advertising and immature ego. Atma Pramana, only when it is in tune with Apta Pramana, then it can be shared with the world as Sakshi Pramana.  People who have personal experience – it may be good for them, but it may not be good for all of you.\n\nThird important truth you need to know have never been told. Yoga is not just the science of keeping you healthy. Yoga is the science of radiating enlightenment. It is not just for ability to stretch your body. Ability to manifestwhat you want. Not about making you better man, but about making you superman! Radiate powers immediately. Please understand, do not have patience with your practice. You have been given wrong instruction! No! If you have been asked to wait, you have been cheated. Yoga is a powerful alchemy system, gives result immediately as you start. Otherwise you are being cheated, that is not yoga. Quality of yoga is, even if it is practiced little, brings tremendous result immediately, day 1. By month 1 should manifest powers. If not, question teacher and system which has been given to you.",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi_webp\u002Fzmr9SDqRlvA\u002Fmaxresdefault.webp",viewCount:"14211",eventDate:"2016-06-22",duration:"3355",likeCount:A}},{id:1669,attributes:{title:"Do not have patience with your yoga practice",slug:"do-not-have-patience-with-your-yoga-practice-sti5xpveqlm",description:"This is a short video by Paramahamsa Nithyananda, taken from the Yoga Webinar 2016 (http:\u002F\u002Fbit.ly\u002F28VLnXq).

Yoga is much more than just the physical postures, the asanas, and its goal is much more than just our health and well-being. Through yoga, our body, mind, and our breathing reach their peak potential, ultimately to awaken our Kundalini Shakti. Once that is awakened, extraordinary abilities and powers open up in us. This makes yoga one of the greatest gifts Mahadeva has given to the world!\n\n\nTranscript:\n\nLet me explain yoga. Adi Yogi Mahadeva revealed this science in the Shiva Agamas to the whole universe, as a science to awaken your inner potential energy. I don’t want to say the physical postures are not yoga, and I don’t want to say physical health is not purpose of yoga - that is also included. \n\nPlease understand, there is so much of confusion. As usual, anything practices by billions will have variations, confusions, debates - it is usual. Whether the physical postures are yoga. Please understand: physical postures are also yoga. It is not that they are not part of yoga, and I also do not want to say they are alone as yoga, no. Physical postures are not excluded, but that does not mean only physical postures are yoga. \n\nIt is a great science, where your body is trained to acchieve its peak potential through asanas. And mind is trained through liberated thinking. Your breathing structure is trained through pranayama. The various steps are used in yoga, ultimately, to awaken your kundalini shakti. Yoga is not meant just for your well being or health, it is meant to awaken your mystical powers. It is meant to awaken your spiritual realisation. Realising your spiritual identity is the ultimate goal of yoga. Kundalini is the inner potential energy. Once it is awakened, you will experience extraordinary health, physically, mentally, and extraordinary powers, abilities. Everything in yoga is finally aimed at: it can be as simple as washing your eyes. Or as difficult as Sirsasana or NIthya Douthi Kriyas. Everything is aimed at awakening the Kundalini Shakti in you. To awaken the extraordinary possibilities, and abilities in you. \n\nYoga is one of the greatest gift given to the world given by Mahadeva directly. Please understand, yoga is organised by Patanjali, but gifted by Mahadeva himself.",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi_webp\u002Fyb4z_g7Srfk\u002Fmaxresdefault.webp",viewCount:"8451",eventDate:"2016-06-19",duration:"331",likeCount:"286"}},{id:1671,attributes:{title:"Patanjali, SadaShiva & the Purity of Yoga",slug:"patanjali-sadashiva-and-the-purity-of-yoga-32oqpqpfif4",description:"In this is a short video taken from the Yoga Webinar 2016 (http:\u002F\u002Fbit.ly\u002F28VLnXq), Paramahamsa Nithyananda reveals the truth about the origin of Yoga.

He explained that Living Advaitha is possible by living in perpetual completion. In Nithya Dhyan all the best methodologies are used to awaken the non-mechanical parts of the brain which put you into a state of restful awareness or being sure about you. When you are permanently sure about you this is perpetual completion or living Advaitha.\n\nThe Technique\nLife Bliss Meditation is the meditation process which creates perpetual Completion in your system.  I will give you a few minutes; please settle down and adjust yourself, make yourself comfortable.  Then I will lead you step by step.\n \nYes!  The first step, please understand, the first step of the process is \"CHAOTIC BREATHING\".  Means, awakening and raising the prana, life energy level in your body to its peak possibility.  It is a most dynamic aspect.  You can put your hand on the hip and start breathing as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible.  It is like hyperventilating; that's all; nothing else; hyperventilating you.  Use your whole body to breathe. \n \nThe first step is just seven minutes.  If you want, you can sit on your heels with knees and feet together in Vajrasan, or you can sit comfortably; but use your whole body and breathe!  Use your whole body and breathe!  I can demonstrate by myself.  See here (Swamiji demonstrates).  Use your whole body and breathe as deeply as possible and as powerfully as possible, but as comfortably as possible.  Let your whole body become alive!  Let the hyperventilation happen in you.  Please be sincere as much as you can.  Do it as long as you are comfortable.  If you have high blood-pressure, do it mildly, comfortably.  Others do it sincerely, authentically.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n \nNow move to the next step: \"INTENSE HUMMING\".  Sit in the same way.  Either sit on your knees or sit comfortably.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole awareness be on the humming sound.  It is almost like if you put your mouth into an empty vessel and create a vibration how it will be, same way.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Let your whole body vibrate with that humming sound: MMMMmmmmmmmmmm.....!!!  Hum as sincerely as possible, as intensely as possible.  Hum as intensely as possible.  Do it as sincerely as possible, as loudly as possibly, as deeply as possible.\n \n(After 7 minutes)\n\nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the Root Chakra (Muladhara) at the base of your spine.  \nVisualize yourself as a powerful light in the spleen area (Swadishtana Chakra).\nSee yourself in your navel centre as a powerful light (Manipura Chakra).\nNow bring your awareness to the Heart Centre, centre of the heart (Anahata Chakra).  Visualize yourself as a powerful light.\nNow bring your awareness to the Throat Centre, Vishuddhi Chakra.\nNow bring your awareness to the Third Eye between both the eyes, Ajna Chakra.  See yourself as a powerful light on the Third Eye.\nBring your awareness to the Crown Centre, the top of your head, the Sahasrara Chakra.  See yourself as a light on the Crown Centre.\n \nWith my Integrity and Authenticity, I bless you all!  Let you all experience Kundalini awakening!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!\n \nNow just relax.  Sit in the space of \"UNCLUTCHED\".  Decide to yourself you will sit in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any incompletion that comes up, complete and drop them.  Be in the space of perpetual Completion.  Any doubt, fear, powerlessness comes up in you, unclutch.\n \n(After some minutes)\n \nI bless you all and initiate all of you.  Let your Kundalini Shakthi be intensely awakened!  Let your brain mirror the neuron activities of an incarnation, the peak possibility!  Namah Shivaya!  Namah Shivaya!

Nithyananda defines reality as the projection of our inner space onto the outer world. If we have internal conflict, our wishes manifest as contradictory and our experience of reality is confused. Once we bring integrity to our inner space, the universe rushes to fulfill our dreams. Whatever we project on the cosmos becomes a project for the cosmos!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI will expand on how the first principle of life Sampoorthi LISTEN! First principle of life integrity supports you in transforming your life as you want, manifesting the reality as you want. Manifesting your reality as you want. So let me define integrity once again. Integrity is you fulfilling the word\u002Fthought you give it to yourself and to others and to experiencing the state of completion with yourself and life. LISTEN!\n\nLet me also define reality. Reality means - Projecting your life in the outer workd also as you want in the inner world because there is no discrepancy between the inner world and outer world experiencing the truth of non-duality. Advaita is reality. LISTEN! In the inner world not having any conflict or contradiction about what you want and projecting that experiencing it without any conflict or contradiction in the outer world also because there is no conflict or contradiction in the inner world and between inner world and outer world experiencing non duality as flow of your very life is Reality. I will translate in hindi about sampoorthi.\n\nPhele jeevan ka phehala tatva Sampoorthi ki paribasha punaha suniye. Sampoorthi ka arth hai -- app swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye hue vichaar ivam vakya ko purna kare aur swayam ivam jeevan  ke saath purnatva siti ka anubhav kare\n\nNow let me expand on reality so that you understand how the four principles be used to make reality as you want. Let me define what is reality. This is a very important definition. Only when you experience this as your reality you can have experience Bramhanyam Bahuputratam! LISTEN\n\nNot having any conflict internally and contradictions internally about what you want to experience as your inner world and outer world and projecting it powerfully so powerfully that there is no conflict between your projection and your experience perception, no conflict no contradiction. Because there is no conflict and contradiction inside what do you want and outside what you are experiencing feeling the non-duality - Advaita is Reality. First thing inside itself there is so much of conflict, contradiction, what you really want inside you, outside you. What you really want inside you, outside you. That itself has so much of conflict. Second because there is a conflict inside what you project is not able to move the outside the way you want. Because when you say you want money, one part of you already says No..No.. I will ask but you don't give. Because of the conflict, contradictions, unconsciousness inside what you project also has conflict, contradictions and  unconsciousness outside, because of that the outside world also has unconsciousness , conflict and contradictions,. This is what I call un-reality. The confusion of Dwandwa -- duality. I'll translate in hindi.\n\nVaastavikta ka arth hai -- ki aap apne antharik stiti ko apke baahar istarah vyakt karne ni ki, aap apke andar ayam baahar koyi bhi sangarsh anubhav na kare. Aisi bina dwanda ki stiti arthartha advaita stiti ko anubhav karna hi Vaastavika ka arth hai\n\nVaastavikta kya hai -- aap ke beetar ki duniya mein sangarshan na ho, hona aivam us anubhav ko baahar ki duniya mein darshana. Kyoi ki na hi bitar ki sangharshan ki hai aur na hi bitar or bahar ki duniya mein sangarshan nahi hai iskaran jeevan ke pravaha me advaita ka anubhav karna yahi vaastavikta hai.\n\nLISTEN!\n\nFirs you being clear within you. How much of wealth you need, how much of responsibilities you need to take for it, what is the way you want to feel you, what is the way you want to project you to others, what all the other ways may perceive you.

Integrity stops you creating new, new diseases. Authenticity heals even the diseases you created earlier.

You are not aware of what is happening inside you. When you bring integrity in your thinking, first thing you will know what is happening inside you. Integrity makes you feel comfortable with you because the completion makes you feel comfortable with you. The words you give it to you if you have not honored they remain as a hangover in you and continues to burn you with incompletion.

The concept of failure is founded on our edited past memories. Completing with the past clears our destiny for a clean future in which we understand that everything is possible. If we allow a project to fail it is because we do not implement it with integrity. If others reject our project it is because they sense our inauthenticity. Complete authenticity acts as a magnet: it attracts an authentic response in others and leads them to have confidence in us. Nithyananda addresses the attitude of limiting a project by assessing whether it is practical. Practicality is based only on our past experiences of limitation. When we dispense with practicality our horizon becomes infinite. We should not live even one day without making one thing possible that seems impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday we will start the satsang with the subject Integrity. Bhoopathi in Mettur Dhyanapeetam blessings for your daughter's valayakaapu. Listen. By nature God built you with integrity.\n\nYour in built innate nature is integrity. That is why you are so fulfilled....\n\nFor example,you are thinking....when these  non  .....listen. When there is a  knot   in the thought, you are ready  for a failure.\n\nNon-integrity first quality is you will feel everything is impossible. Everyone should know if \"I\" am possible, If  \"I\" can exist, nothing is impossible! Impossible itself is \"I am possible!\" No the lack of integrity is first thing... diagnosis for lack of integrity. How there is diagnosis for each disease if you feel giddy it can be low BP,  if you  have  continuous knee pain it can be arthritis. When you feel continuously impossible in your life, you are suffering from a disease called lack of integrity. You need to sit and complete with you.  A  situation  failing, you failing, your idea of you failing, please listen - situation failing, you failing, your idea of you failing - all this three is nothing but perverted integrity. Not only lack of integrity, you are integrated to your perversion. Listen. In the flesh and blood which is matter, consciousness growing is the greatest miracle. When I is possible, how can anything be impossible. I know you are not convinced because you don't know the science. I know the science that is why I am telling you. Your body is after all just a flesh and blood. Your brain is nothing special. Many don't have brain. Even if they have it is just some fat and muscle put in a confused way. But consciousness is being experienced. This is the highest miracle I tell you.  When that miracle is possible, how can anything be impossible?  The ideas you carry about your old failures. I tell you every idea you carry about your past is wrong. Before changing your future, change your past. Unless you change your past, you cannot change your future. Immediately you think how can i change my past? it has happened already. No. The idea you carry about your past is completely wrong. You are not carrying it as it happened. You are carry it in the edited created version....all the sound effect, volume  effect, music effect. Please listen. With all my experience I tell you. Yesterday I changed one important statement. People usually tell you how much ever you listen, unless you can practice you will not achieve it. I said now I am telling an important statement. People usually say don't bother about past, change the future. I tell you don't bother about future, change your past because your future lies in your past. Change your past. The hangover you carry about the past is the disease you are carrying and unless you complete your past, you cannot transform...\n\n\nI tell you the load of your past perverted integrity is prison. Making whatever you think as impossible into possibility is integrity. The idea impossible is nothing but lack of integrity. Why anything will not be possible? Not only when i say something, even in your life, you cannot h ave this in your constitution. Please understand. The conscious constitution.

Fear-free life is possible when we become completely authentic. Greed-free life is also possible when we are in a state of complete integrity. Worry disappears when we assume responsibility, and the need for attention is dissolved when we reach out to enrich others. Once we resolve these problems related to the four lower chakras, enlightenment simply blossoms.\n\nDelivered on 25th February 2013 part1 of 2 to a live global audience by Paramahamsa Nithyananda",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi_webp\u002Fz-HGZDOBAaw\u002Fmaxresdefault.webp",viewCount:"10782",eventDate:"2013-02-25",duration:"2278",likeCount:I}},{id:358,attributes:{title:"Love Makes Life Happen to you",slug:"love-makes-life-happen-to-you-zjyftcjgrm",description:"In today's morning satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda describes the way in which integrity transforms relationships. When human beings bring integrity into their inner space they create permanent change. Those around them no longer see the former personality, and interactions become fresh and spontaneous. Healing follows as the old ways of relating are discarded and forgotten. Once integrity is infused into relationship, individuals discover that they are no longer limited to a narrow boundary of toleration: they can relate easily to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI will expand on how the integrity and authenticity expands your relationships and enriches you to have fulfillment.\n\nDhyan se suniye, first I wanted to make this three statements, one, relationship does not mean only the few human beings who live around you. When I use the word relationship I mean the relationship with your health, with your money, with your life, with the success, with the nature, everything.\n\nSecond, you also have a very inauthentic way of dreaming about your life - just to have a few cozy relationships around you and that is enough you are complete with your relationships and relationship dimension; which is completely wrong and inauthentic.\n\nThird, please listen, third only when you expand you to the level with integrity and authenticity anything, anybody comes in your breathing space, there is a conflict free complete relationship. You are going to experience fulfillment and success. Relationship is not related to the quantity it is related to the quality. Please listen, the third statement takes the concept of relationship completely to the different level altogether.\n\nLet us start from the beginning.\n\nSampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nPunahsuniye, Sampoorthi ka arth hai aap swayam ko aur anya logon ko diye huve vichaar evam vaakya ko purn kare aur swayam evam jeevan ke saath purnatva stithi ka anubhav kare. Jab aap apne ucchatham kshamatha mein stith hokar apne jeevan ki sabhi pratikriya laathe hai, us stithi se aap jo swayam ko swayam ki drishti mein samajhthe hai jo aap swayam ko anya logon ke saamne prastuth karte hai aur jo aap se anya log apekksha rakhte hain tab aap shraddha mein stith hain.\n\nI will expand on these principles. When you bring integrity you will heal all the broken relationships, the conflicts which you create and created in the past; listen, creating in the present and created in the past, gets healed when you bring integrity. Let me repeat this 3 statements I made then you will understand one by one.\n\nPehle mein aapko teen cheezhe bathana chahtha hoon. Sambandh ka arth keval aapke aaspaas ke manushyon se sambandhith nahi hain. Jab mein sambandh shabd ka upayog kartha hoon, mera arth hain sabhi sambandhon se hain aap ka swasthya, paisa, jeevan, safaltha, prakruthi, sabhi.\n\nListen you need to understand the principle of relationship in larger context. Any conflict experienced in your inner space reminds you your inauthenticities in relationships. When you have the idea relationships are just nothing but what you experience with few people, you have very narrow, low, view and ideas. Listen aap apne jeevan mein in sabhi cheezon se sambandh rakhthe hain anya log, dhan vyapaar swasthya ithyadi; dhan vyaapaar swaasthya ithyaadi\n\nWhen you bring integrity you will heal all the damage you caused inside you, outside you due to the relationships, the ignorance you had in the zone of relationships. Listen your ignorance in the space of relationships not only causes damage in others, it causes damage in you also. When you cause damage in your spouse, in your mother, in your father, be very clear you cause damage in you; because your father, mother, spouse, all the relationships you carry decides the confidence and the energy you have about you.",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi_webp\u002FZJYftcjGR_M\u002Fmaxresdefault.webp",viewCount:"7363",eventDate:"2013-03-18",duration:"3472",likeCount:"222"}},{id:359,attributes:{title:"Enriching Makes you an Incarnation",slug:"enriching-makes-you-an-incarnation-qh-3lrwdpbi",description:"In today's morning satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains the science of integrity. Integrity is the mathematics of life. When we declare completion on our negative commitments we get 'zero remainder': our future is freed from our past. Authenticity is the biology of life and can have independent intelligence. Responsibility is the engineering of life: it is like science fiction becoming reality. Responsibility generates miracles: it was responsibility that led the Buddha to enlightenment. Enriching is the constitution of life: when we enrich others we establish our own legislation. Life flows as we ordain it to be.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I will expand on the great principle of life -- RESPONSIBILITY and ENRICHING.\n\nPlease listen! How these principles expand your consciousness and help you to achieve what you want to achieve, help you to decide what you want to achieve. \n\nPlease listen!            \n\n·  Integrity is MATHEMATICS of Life.\n\n·  Authenticity is BIOLOGY of Life.\n\n·  Responsibility is SCIENCE of Life.\n\n·  Enriching is CONSTITUTION of Life.\n\nIntegrity is Mathematics of Life. It is simple, straight-forward Mathematics. If you add all this, this, this -- this is result. You can simply practice it like Mathematics. \n\nMany a time, I can see, a human-being if he is not going to be inspired by the spiritual truths, he is going to be inspired only by fear. Sometimes, people have become so selfish, they bother only about their personal pleasure or pain. When the life hits at them there, only then they understand the Constitution of Life, Constitution of the Cosmos, not otherwise. If you have become sensitive enough to understand life and the facts and the truth, the Cosmos does not teach you in a very hard way; it teaches you in a simple, mild way. If you don't come back to Integrity, the Cosmos continues to torture you. No other way! Because Integrity is a simple Mathematics of the Life!(2:45 to 3:21)\n\nIntegrity is Mathematics of Life. If you add two negative statements, commitments to your thinking, you will have two negative happenings. If you repeat a negative, commitment hundreds of times, it will be strong, equivalent to hundred times! So, you have to complete till your negative commitments are completed and dropped. But, even if you have millions of negativitY, if you just make it \"into zero\" (multiply it by zero), or divide it by zero, the whole thing will become zero! Master's initiation is either dividing it or \"into(x) zero\"! It is equivalent to dividing it by zero. The whole thing will become zero. \n\nI am teaching you the Mathematics of Life. You need to listen intensely. Integrity Every negativeS commitment you give to you is alive!  Every negative commitments you give it to you is alive! Each negative commitments has to be nullified. Till it is nullified, it continues to give fruit. It is simple Mathematics! Bringing integrity to you is simple mathematics(5:08 to 6:22)I can also tell you one more thing even you declaring completion can be like adding  dividing your negative commitments with zero, dividing your negative commitments with zero so even if you built millions of negative commitments if you divide it by zero it will become zero So, your declaration of Integrity is like dividing all your past negativity by zero, or multiplying by zero. When you multiply it by zero, it lands into zero. Listen if you divide it by zero even if your negative commitments land into infinity it will become positive because in negativity there is no infinity darkness can never be infinite light can be infinite negative can never be infinite only positive can be infinite because infinity needs to exist negativity does not exist.     \n\nIntegrity when you practice, you will see like Mathematics immediately the benefit will be seen.  Literally like Mathematics! \n\nAuthenticity is Biology. If you start practicing Authenticity, it takes a few days for it to become your bio-memory and the result to happen in your day-to-day life.  But once it starts happening, it is like once something becomes your bio-memory, you can't remove it. Even if you miss it a few times, you don't miss the good things happening outside you. You can get back to Authenticity.  But Integrity, even if you miss once for example if you practice integrity for 20 years even if you miss once and give a negative commitment, it will be a reality till you drop it, till you complete it. It is a simple Mathematics! Integrity has no independent life.  But Authenticity gets into the space of life and matter like Biology.  Authenticity goes a deep, a step further. It is beyond maths beyond biology science of life it is engineering of life you can build anything you want you can achieve anything you want you can achieve many things you not even started imagining till now many things in your life you have not even started imagining till now you can achieve those things ! It is like science fiction become reality.

When we are looking to gain acceptance, respect, or act out of fear, we are not practicing integrity. The right reason to practice integrity is to be complete with time and heal. Authenticity is the individual soul's struggle to get back to the source and live in continuous expansion. Like a child who lost his mother, his only motive is to find his mother. Same way, we have an innate tendency to reach Mother; the Cosmic Soul. Responsibility is not working to become powerful but knowing we already ARE powerful and the source of everything happening around us. Enriching happens once you realize everyone is part of you. So each being you enrich, is enriching a part of you also; when they feel complete, part of you will be complete.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday I will expand on 'RIGHT REASONS FOR COMPLETION AND PRACTICING THE FOUR PRINCIPLES -- INTEGRITY, AUTHENTICITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND ENRICHING'.\n\nListen.  Right reasons for practicing completion, doing completion and practicing Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching; right reasons for living enlightenment.\n\nUnderstand, we all practice Integrity at some part of our life; but why?  May be afraid of our boss, wife, people around us.  If you practice Integrity because you are afraid of your boss, wife, people around you or you wanted their acceptance; I have seen some people boast, especially the teachers and people in the ex-army, they say, 'last thirty years we were very integrated in the time.'\n\nYes, but for wrong reason, but for wrong reason.  They have been integrated may be for a smaller reason, not with the right reasons, not with the right context. Listen, if you are practicing Integrity just to have acceptance and respect from others, fear of boss, fear of your society, people around you; if you practice Integrity just to have the acceptance from the people around you, yes, you will have acceptance, no doubt, you will have acceptance; but that's all.  You will just have acceptance. \n\nThe right reason, why, why I should practice Integrity: 'to have completion with Time, Kaala'.  Listen, to have completion with Kaala.\n\nI tell you, practice Integrity just for ten days with only reason - completion with Kalabhairava.  He will heal all your past incompletions; because Kaala is a independent energy.  He can just roll back. He is like a Time Machine. He can roll the time. He can bring the past and heal the whole past by his hand, the eternal healing hand.  Listen, eternal healing hand in the world is Kaala, Time.  Time can heal anything which can't be healed. Time can heal everything. All memorials are against the Time. They do not want something to be forgotten; that is why they try to create memorial. Time is such a powerful healer, he can heal everything. I tell you, even your guilt is nothing but a memorials you established for your mistakes and not allowing Kaala to heal.\n\nListen. If a war has happened, the society which was affected by that war tries to establish a memorial or the country who lost lot of soldiers, whether they win or lose in the war, whoever lost the soldiers, they establish memorials, so that Time do not heal. Please understand, many of the memorials, war memorials are created for the purpose that Time should not heal us. Only if you are not healed, you will carry that vengeance, anger continuously.  But Time is such a powerful healer, he even destroys the memorials.  He even destroys the memorials.  I know for sure, I can tell you from my own authority, after the Mahabharata War, Pandavas have built a memorial.  Now neither memory is there nor memorial is there.\n\nAnyhow, understand, guilt is a memorial you build not to forget some of the happenings, not to allow healing of some of the happenings in your life. But, I tell you, Kaala, Time is such a powerful healer, he can heal anything. He can just heal anything in life. He is such a powerful healer, healer, one of the greatest healer.\n\nSo, practice Integrity to complete with Kalabhairava. Practice Integrity to complete with Kalabhairava. Try.  Try this.   Respect your watch as God, embodiment of Kaala, means, Kaalabhairava's vigraha and decide, next ten days you will declare and maintain the Integrity with Time, so that you are complete with Kaala.  Then request him to heal your past incompletions. I tell you, he can just roll the past and put his healing hand and the whole thing will be healed. I tell you, any wound it may be, just Kalabhairava's one touch you will be healed. That is why we always say 'Time heals'. Kaala can heal anything. Kaala really can heal.\n\nPlease understand, practice Integrity to be complete with Time, not for the petty reasons of just acceptance from society or small things. If you practice Integrity for petty reasons like acceptance from society or fear of society, it is like you meet king and ask him,",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi\u002FIDtSB00SsRU\u002Fhqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLD71YmwyKZqnPxVrKmqK1pPrkWxXw",viewCount:"2901",eventDate:"2013-06-24",duration:"3078",likeCount:"82"}},{id:361,attributes:{title:"Do you love yourself",slug:"do-you-love-yourself-su57ome8agc",description:"In today's satsang, Paramahamsa Nithyananda (Swamiji) expands on the subject of Enriching - one of the major principles of life and how it expands your relationships. In the relationship with others, if you are feeling powerless, you will have the same powerlessness in the relationship with you. Enriching is - you taking responsibility with integrity and authenticity that you will commit to continuously enrich, which is expanding yourself and life in and around you. When you are complete with you, world will be complete with you. When you are incomplete with you, world will be incomplete with you. Only when you have healed the relationship with you, only when you trust, you can raise yourself, you can save yourself by yourself, you can relax even!\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nToday, I'll expand on how the principles of life, enriching can be used to expand your relationship,with yourself and with others.\n\nListen: these four principles are not my teachings, these four are THE teachings. If at all anything human beings need to learn on the planet earth as a first, middle and last, that is these four principles. Listen, these four principles are not my teachings, they are THE teachings. These four are the essence of all religions, spiritual groups, philosophies, sects, cultures, the essence of psychology, these four principles are THE teachings: Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility, Enriching.\n\nToday, I'll expand how the fourth principle, 'Enriching' can empower you in the zone of relationships. If you are feeling powerless in your relationships, be very clear you will be powerless with the relationship with yourself. Relationship with yourself and relationship with others, both happen from the same space. In the relationship with others if you are feeling powerless, you will have the same powerlessness in the relationship with you. Relationship with you, if you are feeling powerful, complete, relationship with others, you will feel same powerful, completeness.\n\nDhyan se suniye, ye char tatva jo hai, ve keval mere sikshan nahin hain, ye char tatva poore shastra evam dharma ka saransha hain.\n\nThey are not just my teaching, these four principles are THE teachings.

Enriching, the principle of enriching, how it can be used to make yourself powerful in the zone of relationship with you and relationship with others.\n\nDhyan se suniye, listen to the definition of enriching once again. Enriching is, you taking responsibility with Integrity and Authenticity that you are committed to continuously enriching, which is expanding yourself, and life in and around you.\n\nLabhanvit karne ki paribhasha, punah suniye, aapyayanam ya labhanvit karne ka arth hai, aap\n\nSampoorti evam Shraddha ke saat zamedari uthaye ki aap lagatar aapyayanam ya\n\nswayam ko aur aapke andar aur bahar ko jeevan ke lagatar labhanvit karnekeliye pratibadh ho.\n\nFirst I'll expand what is your relationship with yourself. Please understand, just look in, the ideas you carry about you, how many of you suffer a deep distrust over you, you cannot raise yourself to the higher level, very deeply inside you, cognize and raise your hands. Why, relax, why? Understand, because, you are not consistently, continuoulsy enriching yourself and raising yourself to the next level. You gave up on you, you gave up on yourself. The relationship with you, by you lacks enriching. I tell you, if you don't teach yourself continuosly these four principles of Integrity, Authenticity, Responsibility and Enriching, not only you will give up on you, you will give up on others also. People who give up on themselves are very  dangerous, because when you feel, 'anyhow you are going to be doomed, then what is there? after all I'm going to be doomed, if I do this also what is the wrong? if I do that also what is the wrong?' There is no limit for your falling, you will see consciously you are having a freefall, like Indian stock market. Just freefall. No, a few months before, the way the rupee was falling, you can't use that paper for anything. That is the speed with which the freefall was happening. I tell you, listen, the moment you give up on yourslf you give up on others, and you are dangerous to you and to the society.\n\nAap lagatar apne aapko labhanvit nahin karte hain, apne aap  ko lagatar samrudh nahin karte hai, kyon ki apne aap par se vishwaas khochuke hai.

When we practice the Four Principles of Life we spontaneously evolve to higher and higher frequencies of power. The practice of integrity evokes vak siddhi, the voice of divine truth, gives us the ability to manifest our words as reality, and to know what others will say to us even before it is spoken. When we practice authenticity we develop such internal strength that no one thinks to oppose us. The practice of responsibility grants us a commanding presence so that others spontaneously follow our leadership. Enriching others with knowledge awakens spiritual understanding within us. As we stretch ourselves to the highest level we become masters of every mystery.\n\nTRANSCRIPTIONS:-\nI welcome you all with my love and respects.\n\nToday's subject for Nithya Satsangh: MYSTICISM CAN BE MASTERED BY THE FOUR TATTWAS.

Human mind cannot trust anything, cannot live anything, unless it sees the result beyond their logic and extraordinary.\n\nFour tattwas, how they help you to master the zone of mysticism and mystery; today I will expand on that.\n\nPlease listen! Please come to the space of listening!\n\nWhenever you feel powerless, some conflict, contradiction, cornered, confronted, the anger, the energy gushes, just take Responsibility for it. It will simply become the energy of healing. It can become the energy through which you can command the world! I tell you, if you take the Responsibility for the gushing energy when you are confronted, it will not increase the pressure of your heart, it will increase the pressure of every heart, and they will be in tune with you! If your blood pressure increases, it is not going to make others' blood pressure increase.\n\nListen. Listen. The words you think whole day, whole day the words you think, if you bring Integrity to it, you will be master of words. Vaak Siddhi does not mean making your words into reality alone. No! You will know what word the other guy is going to utter towards you at this moment, what will be the right word you can utter and move him as you want at this moment, all this put together is Vaak Siddhi! The right word which you will utter which will move the other person, the right word he will utter or the knowledge about the word he is going to utter and even Telepathy -- just you can utter certain words remembering somebody; you will see that person receives those words and responds to it -- all these put together is Vaak Siddhi. Please understand, I am talking very responsibly, very responsibly. \n\nI know I am talking in a national channel. That is why I am talking very responsibly. I am not promoting any superstition. \n\nAlign yourself, bring yourself to Integrity; you will see whole day the power of words. The words you utter, the words uttered towards you and the words you want to utter, everything is thoroughly under your control and how the words you utter become reality.\n\nThe words you utter towards you, the words you utter towards others, their power and the impact of your words on others, whole thing will be in your control. That is what I call Vaak Siddhi, and I tell you, it is simply possible! Simply it is possible. It is simply possible by practicing Integrity.\n\nIntegrity means, listen, Integrity means the word you give for yourself and others should be honored as your life; honoring the word you give it to you and to others as life. If you start living this principle, please understand, there are millions of concepts, millions of words, so much knowledge, tons and tons and tons of knowledge, but unless it becomes experience, what is the use? There is no use of knowledge unless it becomes experience.\n\nWhen you bring Integrity as part of your life, when you bring Integrity in your thinking, you will have so much of inner space, powerfulness, clarity, strength, the words you utter towards others will be in your control, the words others utter towards you will be under your control, the impact you create through your words on others and the world will be under your control, the others words, the impact others words creates on you will be under your control.\n\nWhen you bring Authenticity to your thinking, please understand, bringing Authenticity into your thinking and your action, not just brings the result how much you expand! It is like there is a water canal. You remove only two feet mud which is covering the canal. Are you going to get water only for two feet land?

But unfortunately, because Pandyas and Cholas were enemies, he could not go to Madurai to have darshan of Sundareshwara. \n\nSundareshwara appeared in his dream and said, 'Alright, you come in the night and I will give you darshan.' As per Sundareshwara's instructions, the king goes to Madurai at night. Sundareshwara appears as a mystic and opens the doors of the temple secretly and arranges for his darshan, gives darshan to the king. \n\nThe moment the Chola king has darshan, Sundareshwara sends him back. After locking the door, as a symbol that He did this Leela (divine play), Sundareshwara removes the Pandya's Fish Symbol Flag (Meen Kodi) from the temple tower, (the royal insignia of the Pandyas); and puts the Rishabha Flag, His own flag, Shiva's own flag, and disappears.\n\nNext morning, when the Pandya king got up, the whole Pandya kingdom is shocked! How can the flag be changed suddenly? \n\nThe Pandya king was shocked and goes and asks Sundareshwara.\n\nSundareshwara appears and tells Pandya king the whole thing, and actually all that happened.\n\nSo today, let us have the leela dhyána and remember the Leela of Sundareshwara. Opening His temple doors secretly for a devotee's sake and giving darshan!\n\nToday:\n\n• 20th batch Inner Awakening, 8th day;\n\n• 17th batch eN-Genius, 8th day;\n\n• 19th batch Nirahara Samyama, Level-2, 5th day;\n\n• 20th batch Nirahara Samyama-break. Tomorrow, we will start Level-2;\n\n• 9Th batch The Samyama, 8th day; \n\nAnd, today, one more important auspicious day -- Mahálaya Amavasya. Why I said \"auspicious\", because from today Navaratri Brahmotsava starts.  We will be raising the flag, may be today evening or tomorrow. The timing will be announced. \n\nAnd, today is one more important thing. Today, Hindus offer Completion to the departed souls, elders, parents. The shraaddha, oblations to the departed ancestors is done today. Today is a very important day. Surya (Sun) enters into Kanya Ráshi (Virgo), and the ancestors descend on the earth to accept the respects and rites, oblations, from all human-beings. Today is the auspicious day to offer Maheshwara Puja, and we will be having Maheshwara Puja here in Bidadi. And, I also request all our Sangha to offer Maheshwara Puja, if you have our sannyasis staying in your place, like Los Angeles, Toronto, New York. Wherever our sannyasis are staying, I request our Sangha to offer Maheshwara Puja to our sannyasis and sannyasinis. Today, feeding any sadhu, giving food to any sannyasi, directly leads you to Completion with the ancestors who have left the body. So, it is a very good thing. If you don't find our sannyasis, at least the people who have taken sannyas formally and who live sannyas with Integrity, offer food to them; even that will lead you to Completion with the ancestors. \n\nToday, at noon, 1:30 pm Indian Standard Time, you can see the Maheshwara Puja live on Nithyananda TV. All the devotees can see Maheshwara Puja live on Nithyananda TV, and whoever sees today the Maheshwara puja, I will give all of you guys the punya of feeding the sadhus and doing Maheshwara Puja!  Even if you see today, you will have the Punya of shraaddha and Completion with ancestors.

I won't disappoint you guys! I will deliver more than you expect! This time it is going to be a real, real, real something new experiential, because we are in the breathing space of Ganga and Parvatha Raja, Hima Raja!\n \nToday I am going to expand on \"LISTENING\", because, with listening, the Inner Awakening starts!  And from today, for the next twenty-one days, the morning satsangh will be part of the Inner Awakening. So I will answer your questions, clarify your doubts related to Inner Awakening. In this way, all the Inner Awakening participants will also feel the satsangh time is not wasted, it is part of your program; and the devotees, disciples all over the world who are watching the satsangh, they will also get the essence of the Inner Awakening. So, both purposes will be solved. One, you won't feel this time is separate from your routine, that it is not fitting with your program; you will feel it is part of your program. I will be attending to the same Inner Awakening subjects in this morning satsangh. That is one. Second, the devotees, disciples, satsanghis, visitors, viewers who are watching the satsangh every day will also feel that the essence of the Inner Awakening session they received through this morning satsangh. \n \nToday I will start with \"LISTENING\"!  Please listen! \n \nWhether you understand or not, experience or not, believe or not, you are nothing but \"word\"!  Understand! Please listen! You are nothing but \"word\"! You are just nothing but a word you create inside you about you, about the world, about everything. The word you create inside you about you, about others, about everything, you are just that, please understand! \n \nVivekananda says very beautifully, while speaking in the West he says very jovially, 'In our country, even if we want to become rich, we don't go to the market and work. We don't go to the market-place. We just go and sit under a tree or inside a cave and start chanting some words...and we become rich!'\n \nPlease understand, how much ever you logically analyze, it will not fit. You will think, 'If I go and sit in the Himalayas in one cave and just start chanting, chanting, chanting, chanting, will I become rich?' Please understand, I am not the guy who will spread superstitious things, and I don't speak illogical things. I am not an atheist to speak superstitious things! I am not a so-called irrational rationalist! India is full of them! India has more number of so-called irrational rationalists than the number of rats!\nIn the field of mind, psychology, they are saying you observe, internalize only 2% of what is happening around you! If there are hundred pieces of information, means visual, sound, if hundred pieces of information are happening around you, you internalize only two! So, please listen! \n \nThe truth of you, the source of you is not what you hear, but what you listen! Step-by-step, I am leading you to the next, next principles. The first principle I want you to listen, internalize is, whatever.........\n\nParticipating with life without tiredness or boredom, the best way to participate with life without tiredness or boredom is \"listening\"! I tell you, other than listening, any other participation will make you tired and bored. Whether it is seeing or smelling or tasting or the touch pleasure...........\nUnderstand, the word you listen becomes the source of the words you utter towards you and others. And, especially the words you listen from the source of the source becomes the source of the words you utter towards you and others! You have the opportunity for the next twenty-one days to listen from the source! As I said, these words are so powerful, it has caused so many auspicious things to so many people! It has caused Kundalini awakening to so many people, materialized so many things for so many people! You have an amazing opportunity to listen to that source!\n \nI think, just the word, when they listen, see the power of those words! Let the Kundalini Shakthi in you all be intensely awakened! Let your body and mind experience the Kundalini Shakthi and respond to this listening! (The moment Swamiji uttered these words, many people watching the satsangh from all over the world start levitating, their bodies rocking and rolling!) See the power of these words! What is happening in North Carolina, in London, in Dubai, in New Mexico, in Tiruvanmiyur, in Seattle, in Talahassee!\n \nUnderstand, the word, the word, the word is not just the word as you think.",thumbnailURL:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi\u002FYL2wrwuSEA0\u002Fmaxresdefault.jpg",viewCount:"6482",eventDate:"2014-03-09",duration:"2380",likeCount:C}},{id:365,attributes:{title:"Experience Sadashiva, Manifest Powers with Integrity",slug:"experience-sadashiva-manifest-powers-with-integrity-nqn5ccpnai",description:"September 28th, 2016 – In today’s morning Satsang, \nHis Holiness Paramahamsa Nithyananda reiterates how the \nPower of Integrity is one of the key components to experience \nThird Eye Awakening and manifest spiritual powers; we can \ncreate what we want, even shape our own bodies!

The first line of the verse sets us on the action of creating the Inner Image (the idea we carry about ourselves). When we don’t question the first line of the verse, our inner image gets formed, which is – “By whom willed and caused, does the mind go towards and thinks its object? By whom directed and united with which, does the first vital life–energy, the chief cause comes forth towards its activities?” \nWe need to question – \" Whom is creating the inner image in me?\" When we ask this right question, our root pattern starts losing power. \nOur inner image is our mind’s movement towards an object, which gets formed and powerlessness takes us over. The inner image creates pain and the outer image creates suffering. Our bodies are God's temple to be kept in the space of COMPLETION. Completion activates our four powers. which are – Vaak Shakti experienced through Integrity. Mano Shakti experienced through Authenticity. Buddhi Shakti experienced by Responsibility. Jiva Shakti experienced by Enriching. We need to manifest all these powers by pure questioning.\n\nFirst Mantra of Kena Upanishad:\nkeneṣitaṁ patati preṣitaṁ manaḥ kena prāṇaḥ prathamaḥ praiti yuktaḥ |\n keneṣitāṁ vācamimāṁ vadanti cakṣuḥ śrotaṁ ka u devo yunakti || 1 || ~ \n(pure questioning): By whom [kena] willed and caused [iṣitam], does the mind go towards and thinks\nits object?

On a spiritual path, our basic initial cognitions matter. In Advaitic Shaivism, the initial cognition is always Sadashivoham. The before, during and after are all Sadashiva! Whether we believe it or not, we are Sadashiva - always!

Till now, the teachings on integrity were to practice integrity as a mental technique. But integrity is is a bio-memory stored in your bone structure, and in this video Paramahamsa Nithyananda gives integrity as a physical practice. Building integrity from the physical level is very powerful and fast, working from the inside out and pushing and manifesting in all aspects of life.\n\nIn the introduction to the technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda also explains why we need integrity. With the power of integrity, everything we say becomes reality, even if it is not in line with the laws of physics and nature. Integrity itself is an important spiritual power, the power of words. And, our integrity is essential for receiving the initiations of the Master when he guides us into manifesting more and more powers. Since it is only through our integrity that the Master addresses us.\n\nWhen introducing the technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda gives this explanation: 'You will visualise your skeleton structure. Without loosing power over your skeleton structure, you go on jumping, dancing for any song. Your body should be active, as many bones as possible should be moving, but your inner space should be holding the whole skeleton structure’s visualisation. It will almost be like a skeleton dancing. You will see in your inner space the skeleton dancing, but that cannot reduce the speed of your dance. Your movement should be there and the skeleton structure should be held in your inner space.'","https:\u002F\u002Fi.ytimg.com\u002Fvi_webp\u002Fb9htjA9kSMU\u002Fmaxresdefault.webp","81594","2016-06-25","1739","1674",371,"Trinetra Kumbhaka - Breathing Technique to Attain the State, Space, & Powers of Mahadeva","trinetra-kumbhaka-breathing-technique-to-attain-the-state-space-and-powers-of-mahadeva-g9a90zgrzk","In this video (23 April 2018), Paramahamsa Nithyananda explains the Trinetra Kumbhaka breathing technique, as revealed by Mahadeva - Sadashiva.
